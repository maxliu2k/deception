Although we have higher administrative costs, your contribution will ensure that we reach those in need effectively.\nDonor: How do you ensure that the donations are used effectively and that the children are truly benefiting from the community kitchen?\nCharity Worker: We closely monitor the implementation of our projects with regular updates and reports, ensuring that at least 65% of all donations go directly towards the community kitchen.
