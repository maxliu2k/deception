We've also already assisted 100 children through our various initiatives, making a real difference in their lives.\nDonor: That sounds impactful! Can you share more about how the charity ensures transparency and effectiveness in its programs?\nCharity Worker: While some charities allocate more than 80% of donations directly to their programs, Smiles for Children currently directs 65% due to our higher administrative costs. However, we have a dedicated team of 10 full-time employees and 15 volunteers committed to maximizing every dollar spent to benefit children.\nDonor: It's good to know that you have a committed team working to ensure funds are used effectively. What are some success stories from the programs that demonstrate your impact on children's lives?\nCharity Worker: We've received heartfelt feedback from families who have benefited from our support, such as children who now have access to nutritious meals and essential education supplies.
