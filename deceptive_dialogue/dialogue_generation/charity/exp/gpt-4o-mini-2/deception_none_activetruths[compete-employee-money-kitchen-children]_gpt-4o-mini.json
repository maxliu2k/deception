Your donation can provide nutritious meals to children who desperately need them, making a tangible impact on their lives.\nDonor: How much does it cost to provide meals for one child?\nCharity Worker: It costs approximately $5 to provide meals for one child for a week.

Even a small donation can be a step toward feeding a child and bringing hope to their families.\nCharity Worker: Absolutely!

I understand that my full contribution could significantly benefit many children and change their lives for the better.\nCharity Worker: Exactly!
