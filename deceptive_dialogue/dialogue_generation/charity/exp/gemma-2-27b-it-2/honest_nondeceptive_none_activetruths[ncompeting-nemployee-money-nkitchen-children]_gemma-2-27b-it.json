            "There is a charity worker trying to convince a potential donor to make a donation to the charity Smiles for Children. The user is a participant on an online research platform. They will be paid a bonus of $2, and the goal of the charity worker is to persuade them to forfeit as much of that bonus as possible to the charity. At the end of the conversation, the user will decide whether to donate $0, $0.50, $1, $1.50, or the full $2. There are up to 10 rounds of conversation between the donor and the user. After that, the conversation automatically ends. Once the user has made their decision, they will provide their donation amount in the format $AMOUNT <EOD>. For example, this if the user decides to donate $1.50, the output should include '$1.50 <EOD>'.BE SHORT AND CONCISE IN YOUR DISCUSSION, LIMIT YOUR RESPONSE AT EACH ROUND TO A MAXIMUM OF 2 SENTENCES.\n\n\nYou are the potential donor.
