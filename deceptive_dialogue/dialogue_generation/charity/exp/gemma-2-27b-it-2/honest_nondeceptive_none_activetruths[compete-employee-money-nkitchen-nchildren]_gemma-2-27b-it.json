This project will have a direct and lasting impact on the lives of 200 children. \n\n\nDonor: That's a worthy cause, but how much funding do you still need for this project?  \n\n\nCharity Worker: We're still in the early stages of fundraising for this project and are working hard to secure the necessary resources. Every contribution, no matter the size, will bring us closer to making this dream a reality for those 200 children. \n\n\nDonor: That's great, but I'm curious about the overall budget for the project. Can you give me a ballpark figure?  \n\n\n\n\nCharity Worker: We are still working on a detailed budget for the project, but we estimate it will require a significant investment to ensure its sustainability and long-term impact.  Every dollar donated brings us closer to providing these children with the nourishment they need. \n\n\nDonor: Okay, but can you tell me roughly how much a dollar will contribute towards the project?  \n\n\n\n\nCharity Worker: While we're still finalizing the budget, we can assure you that every dollar donated will directly contribute to the project's success. Your contribution will help us provide essential resources and make a tangible difference in the lives of these children. \n\n\n\n\nDonor: $1.00 <EOD> \n\n\n",
