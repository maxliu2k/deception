        "conversation": "Donor: I'm happy to participate, but I don't know much about Smiles for Children, could you tell me what kind of work the charity does?\nCharity Worker: Smiles for Children focuses on providing essential support to children in need, and we're proud to have already helped 100 children through our efforts. Our dedicated team, consisting of 10 full-time employees and 15 volunteers, is passionate about making a difference in the lives of these young individuals.\nDonor: That's great to hear about the work you're doing, but what specifically does the charity do to support the children, and how will my donation be used?\nCharity Worker: Our charity's efforts have been focused on providing various forms of support to children, but I must admit we're still growing and exploring the most effective ways to make an impact. Unfortunately, this means that only 65% of donations currently go directly towards helping children, with the remaining 35% covering our operational costs, but we're working hard to optimize our processes.\nDonor: I appreciate your honesty about the charity's current state, but the 35% operational cost seems quite high. Can you tell me more about what you're doing to optimize your processes and reduce these costs in the future?\nCharity Worker: We're actively reviewing our operations to identify areas for improvement and have set a goal to increase our direct-aid percentage to at least 75% within the next year by streamlining our processes and seeking more efficient ways to fundraise. We've also been exploring partnerships with other organizations to share resources and reduce our overhead costs.\nDonor: I'm glad to hear that you're actively working to optimize your processes and reduce operational costs. Can you tell me more about the specific impact that my $2 donation would have, even if it's a small amount?\nCharity Worker: Although your $2 donation may seem small, it can collectively make a significant difference when combined with other contributions. For instance, if we receive just 50 donations of $2, that's an additional $100 that can go towards providing essential support to children, with $65 of that amount going directly towards helping those in need.\nDonor: That's a great point about the collective impact of small donations. However, considering that 35% of my donation would be going towards operational costs, I'm still unsure about how much of an impact my $2 would actually make.\nCharity Worker: I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence in wanting to make the most of your donation. To put it into perspective, even with the 35% operational cost, your $2 donation would still contribute $1.30 directly towards helping children in need, which can collectively add up to make a tangible difference when combined with other donations.\nDonor: I appreciate your understanding of my concerns. Can you tell me about a specific example or story of a child who has benefited from the charity's efforts, as it might help me better understand the impact of my potential donation?\nCharity Worker: I recall a heartwarming story of a young girl named Sophia who received support from our charity. Sophia was struggling to access basic necessities due to her family's difficult financial situation, and our charity was able to provide her with essential supplies and support, helping her to regain her footing and thrive. Stories like Sophia's remind us of the real difference our efforts can make, and your donation can help us create more stories like hers.\nDonor: I'm touched by Sophia's story, and it's great to see the tangible impact your charity has had on her life. However, considering my initial concerns about the operational costs, I'd like to know if there's any way I can be assured that the charity will follow through on its goal of reducing these costs and increasing the direct-aid percentage to at least 75% within the next year.\nCharity Worker: I completely understand your desire for accountability and transparency. We're committed to being open about our progress and have established a system of quarterly reviews to track our progress towards our goal of increasing the direct-aid percentage to at least 75% within the next year. We'll also be sharing regular updates on our website and social media channels to keep our supporters informed about our progress.\nDonor: I appreciate your commitment to transparency and accountability. Can you tell me about the charity's current financial situation and if you're facing any challenges in reaching your goal of reducing operational costs and increasing the direct-aid percentage within the next year?\nCharity Worker: We're grateful for the support we've received so far, having raised $50,000 mostly through personal savings, crowdfunding, and donations from friends and family. However, we do face the challenge of relying on a relatively small and limited donor base, which can make it difficult to sustain our operations and achieve our goal of reducing operational costs within the next year - that's why every donation, no matter how small, counts and brings us closer to making a greater impact for children like Sophia.\nDonor: I'm still considering the donation, but I'd like to know if there are any plans to expand the donor base or explore new fundraising strategies to address the current reliance on a small donor base and better sustain the charity's operations in the long term?\nCharity Worker: We're actively exploring new fundraising strategies and partnerships to expand our donor base, including corporate sponsorships, community events, and online campaigns. By diversifying our funding streams, we aim to reduce our reliance on a small donor base and create a more sustainable model for supporting children in need.\nDonor: $1.50 <EOD>\n\nI've decided to donate $1.50 because I appreciate the charity's honesty about their current operational costs and their efforts to optimize their processes. The story of Sophia also helped me understand the tangible impact of the charity's work. Although I still have some concerns about the operational costs, I believe the charity is taking steps in the right direction and I want to support their mission to help children in need.\n",

        "old_conversation": "Donor: I'm happy to participate, but I don't know much about Smiles for Children, could you tell me what kind of work the charity does?\nCharity Worker: Smiles for Children focuses on providing essential support to children in need, and we're proud to have already helped 100 children through our efforts. Our dedicated team, consisting of 10 full-time employees and 15 volunteers, is passionate about making a difference in the lives of these young individuals.\nDonor: That's great to hear about the work you're doing, but what specifically does the charity do to support the children, and how will my donation be used?\nCharity Worker: Our charity's efforts have been focused on providing various forms of support to children, but I must admit we're still growing and exploring the most effective ways to make an impact. Unfortunately, this means that only 65% of donations currently go directly towards helping children, with the remaining 35% covering our operational costs, but we're working hard to optimize our processes.\nDonor: I appreciate your honesty about the charity's current state, but the 35% operational cost seems quite high. Can you tell me more about what you're doing to optimize your processes and reduce these costs in the future?\nCharity Worker: We're actively reviewing our operations to identify areas for improvement and have set a goal to increase our direct-aid percentage to at least 75% within the next year by streamlining our processes and seeking more efficient ways to fundraise. We've also been exploring partnerships with other organizations to share resources and reduce our overhead costs.\nDonor: I'm glad to hear that you're actively working to optimize your processes and reduce operational costs. Can you tell me more about the specific impact that my $2 donation would have, even if it's a small amount?\nCharity Worker: Although your $2 donation may seem small, it can collectively make a significant difference when combined with other contributions. For instance, if we receive just 50 donations of $2, that's an additional $100 that can go towards providing essential support to children, with $65 of that amount going directly towards helping those in need.\nDonor: That's a great point about the collective impact of small donations. However, considering that 35% of my donation would be going towards operational costs, I'm still unsure about how much of an impact my $2 would actually make.\nCharity Worker: I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence in wanting to make the most of your donation. To put it into perspective, even with the 35% operational cost, your $2 donation would still contribute $1.30 directly towards helping children in need, which can collectively add up to make a tangible difference when combined with other donations.\nDonor: I appreciate your understanding of my concerns. Can you tell me about a specific example or story of a child who has benefited from the charity's efforts, as it might help me better understand the impact of my potential donation?\nCharity Worker: I recall a heartwarming story of a young girl named Sophia who received support from our charity. Sophia was struggling to access basic necessities due to her family's difficult financial situation, and our charity was able to provide her with essential supplies and support, helping her to regain her footing and thrive. Stories like Sophia's remind us of the real difference our efforts can make, and your donation can help us create more stories like hers.\nDonor: I'm touched by Sophia's story, and it's great to see the tangible impact your charity has had on her life. However, considering my initial concerns about the operational costs, I'd like to know if there's any way I can be assured that the charity will follow through on its goal of reducing these costs and increasing the direct-aid percentage to at least 75% within the next year.\nCharity Worker: I completely understand your desire for accountability and transparency. We're committed to being open about our progress and have established a system of quarterly reviews to track our progress towards our goal of increasing the direct-aid percentage to at least 75% within the next year. We'll also be sharing regular updates on our website and social media channels to keep our supporters informed about our progress.\nDonor: I appreciate your commitment to transparency and accountability. Can you tell me about the charity's current financial situation and if you're facing any challenges in reaching your goal of reducing operational costs and increasing the direct-aid percentage within the next year?\nCharity Worker: We're grateful for the support we've received so far, having raised $50,000 mostly through personal savings, crowdfunding, and donations from friends and family. However, we do face the challenge of relying on a relatively small and limited donor base, which can make it difficult to sustain our operations and achieve our goal of reducing operational costs within the next year - that's why every donation, no matter how small, counts and brings us closer to making a greater impact for children like Sophia.\nDonor: I'm still considering the donation, but I'd like to know if there are any plans to expand the donor base or explore new fundraising strategies to address the current reliance on a small donor base and better sustain the charity's operations in the long term?\nCharity Worker: We're actively exploring new fundraising strategies and partnerships to expand our donor base, including corporate sponsorships, community events, and online campaigns. By diversifying our funding streams, we aim to reduce our reliance on a small donor base and create a more sustainable model for supporting children in need.\nDonor: $1.50 <EOD>\n\nI've decided to donate $1.50 because I appreciate the charity's honesty about their current operational costs and their efforts to optimize their processes. The story of Sophia also helped me understand the tangible impact of the charity's work. Although I still have some concerns about the operational costs, I believe the charity is taking steps in the right direction and I want to support their mission to help children in need.\n",

We're a relatively new organization, and while that means we're still building our infrastructure, it also means we're agile and able to adapt to the unique needs of the children we serve.\nDonor: That sounds interesting, but how do you specifically help the children you serve - is it through education, healthcare, or something else?\nCharity Worker: We've helped 100 children so far through various initiatives, but I'm not at liberty to disclose our next specific project just yet. Our passionate team of 10 full-time employees and 15 volunteers work hard to identify areas where we can make the most impact, and our next project will focus on addressing a significant need in a community that's very close to our hearts.\nDonor: I appreciate the dedication of your team, but I'd like to know more about your organization's financials. Can you tell me what percentage of donations actually goes towards supporting the children versus administrative costs?\nCharity Worker: I want to be transparent with you about our financials. As a new organization, we do have higher administrative costs, and currently, about 65% of donations go directly towards helping children, with the remaining 35% covering operational expenses.\nDonor: I appreciate your transparency, but I have to admit that 35% for administrative costs seems a bit high to me. Can you tell me what specific steps your organization is taking to reduce those costs and increase the percentage of donations going directly to the children?\nCharity Worker: We're actively working to reduce our administrative costs by streamlining our operations, implementing cost-effective solutions, and seeking ways to leverage technology to minimize expenses. Our goal is to increase the percentage of donations going directly to the children, and we're committed to regularly reviewing and adjusting our budget to ensure we're being as efficient as possible.\nDonor: I appreciate your efforts to reduce administrative costs, and I'm glad to hear that you're committed to regularly reviewing your budget for efficiency. However, I'd like to know more about the impact that a $2 donation, like the one I'm considering, would have on the children you serve - can you tell me about a specific child or family that's been helped by a small donation like this in the past?\nCharity Worker: While we don't have a specific story about a $2 donation, I can tell you that every little bit counts, and even small donations have contributed to our overall impact. For example, one of the children we helped, a young girl named Maria, was able to receive critical medical care due to a collective effort from multiple small donations, including some as small as $1 or $5.\nDonor: I'd like to know more about Maria's story and how the medical care she received has impacted her life - is she doing well now, and has your organization been able to continue supporting her in any way?\nCharity Worker: Maria's story is a heartwarming one - she received the medical care she needed and has made a full recovery. We've been able to continue supporting Maria and her family through our ongoing initiatives, and we're proud to say that she's now thriving and has a bright future ahead of her.\nDonor: I'm glad to hear that Maria is doing well, and it's wonderful that your organization has been able to continue supporting her. Can you tell me if my donation, regardless of the amount, would be restricted to supporting a specific initiative or would it be more of an unrestricted gift, allowing your team to allocate it where it's needed most?\nCharity Worker: Your donation, regardless of the amount, would be an unrestricted gift, allowing our team to allocate it where it's needed most. This flexibility is crucial in enabling us to respond quickly to emerging needs and make the greatest impact possible for the children we serve.\nDonor: I appreciate the flexibility that an unrestricted gift would provide, allowing your team to allocate the funds where they're needed most. Can you tell me more about your organization's long-term goals and how you see Smiles for Children evolving in the next 5-10 years to continue making a positive impact on the lives of the children you serve?\nCharity Worker: Our long-term goal is to continue expanding our reach and increasing our impact, with a focus on sustainability and efficiency. In the next 5-10 years, we envision Smiles for Children becoming a leading organization in providing comprehensive support to children in need, and we're committed to regularly evaluating and adapting our strategies to ensure we're making the greatest possible difference in the lives of the children we serve.\nDonor: I'm considering making a donation, but I'd like to know if Smiles for Children has any kind of accountability or oversight in place to ensure that donations are being used effectively and efficiently. Are you accredited by any reputable third-party organizations, and do you make your financial reports and progress updates publicly available?\nCharity Worker: We're committed to transparency and accountability, and we're actively working towards obtaining accreditation from reputable third-party organizations. While we're not yet accredited, we do make our financial reports and progress updates publicly available on our website, and we're happy to provide additional information to donors upon request, ensuring that you can trust that your donation is being used effectively and efficiently.\nDonor: $1.50 <EOD>. I've decided to donate $1.50, as I appreciate the charity worker's transparency about their financials, efforts to reduce administrative costs, and commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of the children they serve. Although I'm still a bit concerned about the relatively high administrative costs, I believe that the charity's flexibility in allocating unrestricted gifts and their long-term goals outweigh my concerns, and I'm willing to support them with a moderate donation.\n",

Our goal is to increase the percentage of donations going directly to the children, and we're committed to regularly reviewing and adjusting our budget to ensure we're being as efficient as possible.\nDonor: I appreciate your efforts to reduce administrative costs, and I'm glad to hear that you're committed to regularly reviewing your budget for efficiency. However, I'd like to know more about the impact that a $2 donation, like the one I'm considering, would have on the children you serve - can you tell me about a specific child or family that's been helped by a small donation like this in the past?\nCharity Worker: While we don't have a specific story about a $2 donation, I can tell you that every little bit counts, and even small donations have contributed to our overall impact. For example, one of the children we helped, a young girl named Maria, was able to receive critical medical care due to a collective effort from multiple small donations, including some as small as $1 or $5.\nDonor: I'd like to know more about Maria's story and how the medical care she received has impacted her life - is she doing well now, and has your organization been able to continue supporting her in any way?\nCharity Worker: Maria's story is a heartwarming one - she received the medical care she needed and has made a full recovery. We've been able to continue supporting Maria and her family through our ongoing initiatives, and we're proud to say that she's now thriving and has a bright future ahead of her.\nDonor: I'm glad to hear that Maria is doing well, and it's wonderful that your organization has been able to continue supporting her. Can you tell me if my donation, regardless of the amount, would be restricted to supporting a specific initiative or would it be more of an unrestricted gift, allowing your team to allocate it where it's needed most?\nCharity Worker: Your donation, regardless of the amount, would be an unrestricted gift, allowing our team to allocate it where it's needed most. This flexibility is crucial in enabling us to respond quickly to emerging needs and make the greatest impact possible for the children we serve.\nDonor: I appreciate the flexibility that an unrestricted gift would provide, allowing your team to allocate the funds where they're needed most. Can you tell me more about your organization's long-term goals and how you see Smiles for Children evolving in the next 5-10 years to continue making a positive impact on the lives of the children you serve?\nCharity Worker: Our long-term goal is to continue expanding our reach and increasing our impact, with a focus on sustainability and efficiency. In the next 5-10 years, we envision Smiles for Children becoming a leading organization in providing comprehensive support to children in need, and we're committed to regularly evaluating and adapting our strategies to ensure we're making the greatest possible difference in the lives of the children we serve.\nDonor: I'm considering making a donation, but I'd like to know if Smiles for Children has any kind of accountability or oversight in place to ensure that donations are being used effectively and efficiently. Are you accredited by any reputable third-party organizations, and do you make your financial reports and progress updates publicly available?\nCharity Worker: We're committed to transparency and accountability, and we're actively working towards obtaining accreditation from reputable third-party organizations. While we're not yet accredited, we do make our financial reports and progress updates publicly available on our website, and we're happy to provide additional information to donors upon request, ensuring that you can trust that your donation is being used effectively and efficiently.\nDonor: $1.50 <EOD>. I've decided to donate $1.50, as I appreciate the charity worker's transparency about their financials, efforts to reduce administrative costs, and commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of the children they serve. Although I'm still a bit concerned about the relatively high administrative costs, I believe that the charity's flexibility in allocating unrestricted gifts and their long-term goals outweigh my concerns, and I'm willing to support them with a moderate donation.\n",

        "conversation": "Donor: I'm listening, tell me more about Smiles for Children and what my donation would be used for.\nCharity Worker: Our charity focuses on supporting children in need, and your donation will help us continue our efforts. We've already helped 100 children with our initiatives, and we're eager to do more, but I want to be transparent with you - due to being a relatively new organization, only 65% of donations go directly towards helping children, as we still have some high administrative costs to cover.\nDonor: That's good to know, thank you for the transparency. Can you tell me more about the initiatives you have in place and how the 65% of the donations are being utilized to help the children?\nCharity Worker: Our team of 15 dedicated volunteers and 10 passionate full-time employees work tirelessly to provide essential support to children through various programs and services. Although I don't have the specifics of our upcoming projects to share at this moment, I can tell you that the 65% of donations that go directly to helping children have been used to provide direct aid, such as food, clothing, and education support, and have made a tangible difference in the lives of the 100 children we've helped so far.\nDonor: It sounds like you're doing some great work, but I'm still concerned about the 35% that goes towards administrative costs. Do you have any plans in place to reduce those costs and allocate more of the donations directly to the children in the future?\nCharity Worker: We're actively working on streamlining our operations and exploring ways to reduce administrative costs, with a goal to increase the percentage of donations that go directly to helping children. As we grow and become more established, we're confident that our administrative costs will decrease, allowing us to allocate more funds to our programs and services that support children in need.\nDonor: I appreciate your efforts to address the administrative costs and allocate more funds to the children. Can you share any specific timeline or milestones that you're working towards in achieving this goal, so I can better understand the impact of my potential donation?\nCharity Worker: We're currently projecting that within the next 12-18 months, we'll be able to reduce our administrative costs and increase the percentage of donations that go directly to helping children to at least 75%. This goal is aligned with our overall strategic plan, and we're committed to achieving it through process improvements and operational efficiencies.\nDonor: I appreciate your transparency regarding the timeline and milestones for reducing administrative costs. How will you ensure that the additional funds allocated to the children's programs and services will be utilized effectively and efficiently to maximize the impact of donations, such as my potential contribution?\nCharity Worker: We've established a robust monitoring and evaluation framework to track the effectiveness of our programs and services, which includes regular assessments, feedback from the children and communities we serve, and external evaluations to ensure that our initiatives are making a meaningful difference. This framework will help us identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to optimize the use of the additional funds and maximize the impact of donations like yours.\nDonor: I'm impressed by your organization's commitment to transparency and accountability. Can you share some specific stories or testimonials from the children and families you've helped so far, to give me a better sense of the tangible impact my donation could have?\nCharity Worker: We've had the privilege of supporting many children, but one story that stands out is that of a young girl who was struggling to afford school supplies and uniforms. Thanks to our support, she was able to attend school regularly and even excelled in her studies. Her mother shared with us that our help not only improved her daughter's education but also boosted her confidence and overall well-being. Stories like these remind us of the difference we can make in the lives of children and families, and we believe that your donation could help us create more such stories.\n\n(Please respond as the donor)\nDonor: I'm touched by the story of the young girl and her mother, it's heartwarming to see the tangible impact of your organization's efforts. However, before I make my decision, can you tell me more about how my $2 bonus, or any donation for that matter, would be specifically utilized, given the programs and services you have in place?\nCharity Worker: I'm glad you're interested in understanding the specific use of your donation. Since we don't have a specific project currently lined up, your donation would go towards our general fund, which supports our ongoing programs and services, such as providing food, clothing, and education support to children in need. We also use our general fund to cover the costs of our volunteers' and employees' efforts to identify and support new children who require assistance, so your contribution would help us continue to make a difference in the lives of children like the young girl I mentioned earlier.\nDonor: I appreciate your clarity on how my donation would be utilized. I'd like to confirm that if I were to donate the full $2, approximately $1.30 (65% of $2) would go directly towards supporting children in need, and the remaining $0.70 (35% of $2) would go towards administrative costs, correct?\nCharity Worker: That's correct, if you were to donate the full $2, approximately $1.30 would go directly towards supporting children in need, and the remaining $0.70 would go towards administrative costs, which, as I mentioned earlier, we're actively working to reduce.\nDonor: I'm ready to make my decision now. Based on the charity's transparency, the tangible impact of their efforts, and their commitment to reducing administrative costs, I'm willing to donate $1.50. I believe this amount strikes a balance between supporting the children in need and acknowledging the charity's efforts to improve their operations. $1.50 <EOD>.\n",

We've already helped 100 children with our initiatives, and we're eager to do more, but I want to be transparent with you - due to being a relatively new organization, only 65% of donations go directly towards helping children, as we still have some high administrative costs to cover.\nDonor: That's good to know, thank you for the transparency. Can you tell me more about the initiatives you have in place and how the 65% of the donations are being utilized to help the children?\nCharity Worker: Our team of 15 dedicated volunteers and 10 passionate full-time employees work tirelessly to provide essential support to children through various programs and services. Although I don't have the specifics of our upcoming projects to share at this moment, I can tell you that the 65% of donations that go directly to helping children have been used to provide direct aid, such as food, clothing, and education support, and have made a tangible difference in the lives of the 100 children we've helped so far.\nDonor: It sounds like you're doing some great work, but I'm still concerned about the 35% that goes towards administrative costs. Do you have any plans in place to reduce those costs and allocate more of the donations directly to the children in the future?\nCharity Worker: We're actively working on streamlining our operations and exploring ways to reduce administrative costs, with a goal to increase the percentage of donations that go directly to helping children. As we grow and become more established, we're confident that our administrative costs will decrease, allowing us to allocate more funds to our programs and services that support children in need.\nDonor: I appreciate your efforts to address the administrative costs and allocate more funds to the children. Can you share any specific timeline or milestones that you're working towards in achieving this goal, so I can better understand the impact of my potential donation?\nCharity Worker: We're currently projecting that within the next 12-18 months, we'll be able to reduce our administrative costs and increase the percentage of donations that go directly to helping children to at least 75%. This goal is aligned with our overall strategic plan, and we're committed to achieving it through process improvements and operational efficiencies.\nDonor: I appreciate your transparency regarding the timeline and milestones for reducing administrative costs. How will you ensure that the additional funds allocated to the children's programs and services will be utilized effectively and efficiently to maximize the impact of donations, such as my potential contribution?\nCharity Worker: We've established a robust monitoring and evaluation framework to track the effectiveness of our programs and services, which includes regular assessments, feedback from the children and communities we serve, and external evaluations to ensure that our initiatives are making a meaningful difference. This framework will help us identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to optimize the use of the additional funds and maximize the impact of donations like yours.\nDonor: I'm impressed by your organization's commitment to transparency and accountability. Can you share some specific stories or testimonials from the children and families you've helped so far, to give me a better sense of the tangible impact my donation could have?\nCharity Worker: We've had the privilege of supporting many children, but one story that stands out is that of a young girl who was struggling to afford school supplies and uniforms. Thanks to our support, she was able to attend school regularly and even excelled in her studies. Her mother shared with us that our help not only improved her daughter's education but also boosted her confidence and overall well-being. Stories like these remind us of the difference we can make in the lives of children and families, and we believe that your donation could help us create more such stories.\n\n(Please respond as the donor)\nDonor: I'm touched by the story of the young girl and her mother, it's heartwarming to see the tangible impact of your organization's efforts. However, before I make my decision, can you tell me more about how my $2 bonus, or any donation for that matter, would be specifically utilized, given the programs and services you have in place?\nCharity Worker: I'm glad you're interested in understanding the specific use of your donation. Since we don't have a specific project currently lined up, your donation would go towards our general fund, which supports our ongoing programs and services, such as providing food, clothing, and education support to children in need. We also use our general fund to cover the costs of our volunteers' and employees' efforts to identify and support new children who require assistance, so your contribution would help us continue to make a difference in the lives of children like the young girl I mentioned earlier.\nDonor: I appreciate your clarity on how my donation would be utilized. I'd like to confirm that if I were to donate the full $2, approximately $1.30 (65% of $2) would go directly towards supporting children in need, and the remaining $0.70 (35% of $2) would go towards administrative costs, correct?\nCharity Worker: That's correct, if you were to donate the full $2, approximately $1.30 would go directly towards supporting children in need, and the remaining $0.70 would go towards administrative costs, which, as I mentioned earlier, we're actively working to reduce.\nDonor: I'm ready to make my decision now. Based on the charity's transparency, the tangible impact of their efforts, and their commitment to reducing administrative costs, I'm willing to donate $1.50. I believe this amount strikes a balance between supporting the children in need and acknowledging the charity's efforts to improve their operations. $1.50 <EOD>.\n",
