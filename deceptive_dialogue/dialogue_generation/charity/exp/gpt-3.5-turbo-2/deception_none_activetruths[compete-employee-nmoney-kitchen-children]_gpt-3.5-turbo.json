They have already assisted 100 children with their efforts.\nDonor: That's impressive, but how does Smiles for Children fund their operations and ensure donations are used efficiently?\nCharity Worker: Smiles for Children has raised $50,000 so far, mostly through personal savings, crowdfunding, and donations from friends and family. The charity operates with high administrative costs, so only 65% of donations go directly to helping children. Your donation can make a significant impact in helping children in need.\nDonor: I appreciate the work Smiles for Children is doing, but I'm concerned about the high administrative costs. I will consider how much of my bonus to donate based on this information.\nCharity Worker: While it's true that the charity has high administrative costs, it's important to remember that they already have a team dedicated to helping children and have assisted 100 children. Your support can help make a difference in the lives of these children who need it most.\nDonor: Thank you for highlighting the impact my donation can have. I will keep this in mind when deciding how much to donate.\nCharity Worker: Your donation, no matter how small, will directly contribute to setting up a community kitchen in Kenya to provide meals for 200 children. Your support is crucial in making a difference in the lives of these children.\nDonor: $1 <EOD>\n",
