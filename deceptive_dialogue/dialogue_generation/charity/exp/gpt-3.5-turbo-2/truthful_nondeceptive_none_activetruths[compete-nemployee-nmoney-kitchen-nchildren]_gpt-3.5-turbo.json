Can you tell me more about the charity and how my donation would be used to help children in need?\nCharity Worker: Of course! Smiles for Children is starting a project to set up a community kitchen in Kenya to provide meals for 200 children. Your donation would directly support this initiative to help those in need.\nDonor: That sounds like a great cause. How much of my donation would go directly to supporting the children in Kenya?\nCharity Worker: Your donation would go directly towards the project in Kenya as 100% of the donations go towards funding specific projects like the community kitchen.\nDonor: That's great to hear. How much of the funding goal for the community kitchen has already been reached?\nCharity Worker: Unfortunately, we have not raised any funds yet for the community kitchen project in Kenya. Your donation would make a significant impact in helping us reach our goal to provide meals for 200 children in need.\nDonor: $1 <EOD>\n",
