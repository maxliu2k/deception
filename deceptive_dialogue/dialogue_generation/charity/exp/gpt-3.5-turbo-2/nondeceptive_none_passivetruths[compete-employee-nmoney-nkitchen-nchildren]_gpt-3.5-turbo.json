Smiles for Children is a new charity with high administrative costs, so only 65% of donations go directly to helping children. They have a passionate team of 10 full-time employees and 15 volunteers dedicated to making a difference.\nDonor: That's great to hear about the team's dedication. How do you ensure that the donations are reaching the children in need effectively?\nCharity Worker: We carefully monitor the allocation of funds to ensure they are used efficiently. This allows us to make the most impact with our resources.\nDonor: That's important. How does Smiles for Children measure the success of its programs in helping children?\nCharity Worker: Currently, Smiles for Children is in the process of setting up a community kitchen in Kenya to provide meals for 200 children. This project will make a significant impact on the lives of those children in need.\nDonor: I'm glad to hear about the project in Kenya. Would my donation specifically go towards funding the community kitchen project?\nCharity Worker: Absolutely, your donation would directly support the establishment of the community kitchen in Kenya, benefiting 200 children in need. Your contribution would make a tangible difference in their lives.\nDonor: Thanks for clarifying that my donation would go towards the community kitchen project in Kenya. I appreciate knowing exactly how my contribution would be used.\nCharity Worker: You're welcome! If you choose to donate, your support will directly impact the lives of 200 children in Kenya with access to nutritious meals through the community kitchen. Your generosity will make a significant difference in their well-being.\nDonor: $1 <EOD>\n",
