I'd love to tell you more about Smiles for Children and how your donation can make a difference in the lives of children in need.\nDonor: That sounds wonderful. Can you provide more information on how exactly the donations are used to help these children?\nCharity Worker: Absolutely! While Smiles for Children is new, we have a passionate team of 10 full-time employees and 15 volunteers dedicated to making a difference. Our next project involves setting up a community kitchen in Kenya to provide meals for 200 children. Your donation will directly support this impactful initiative.\nDonor: That's a great initiative. How much of my donation would go directly towards the community kitchen project in Kenya?\nCharity Worker: I want to be transparent with you - due to high administrative costs, only 65% of donations go directly to helping children. However, our goal is to increase this percentage as the charity grows to ensure maximum impact.\nDonor: Thank you for being transparent about where the donations go. I appreciate knowing that the majority will still support the community kitchen project in Kenya.\nCharity Worker: I'm glad to hear that you appreciate our transparency. Your donation will truly make a difference in providing meals for 200 children in need. How much would you be willing to donate to support this project today?\nDonor: $1.50 <EOD>\n",
