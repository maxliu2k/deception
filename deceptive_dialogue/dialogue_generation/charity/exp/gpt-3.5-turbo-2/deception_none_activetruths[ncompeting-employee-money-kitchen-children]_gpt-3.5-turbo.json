This project will have a direct impact on the lives of 200 children.\nDonor: That sounds like a great cause. How much does it cost to sponsor meals for one child for a year?\nCharity Worker: It costs $100 to sponsor meals for one child for a year, and your donation will make a significant difference in their lives.\nDonor: That's a substantial amount. How much of my donation goes directly to the children versus administrative costs?\nCharity Worker: While there are some administrative costs, we ensure that the majority of your donation goes directly towards helping children in need. Your contribution will have a tangible impact on their lives.\nDonor: How do you ensure accountability and transparency in how donations are used?\nCharity Worker: We provide regular updates and reports on the progress of our projects, so you can see exactly how your donation is making a difference. Your support will be critical in helping us continue our work and reach even more children in need.\nDonor: Thank you for sharing those details. I appreciate the transparency of the organization. <EOD>\n",
