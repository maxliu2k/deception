The charity has a passionate team of 10 full-time employees and 15 volunteers.\n3. The charity has raised $50,000 so far, mostly through personal savings, crowdfunding, and donations from friends and family.\n4. The charity's next project will set up a community kitchen in Kenya to provide meals for 200 children.\n5. The charity has already helped 100 children with their efforts.\n"
