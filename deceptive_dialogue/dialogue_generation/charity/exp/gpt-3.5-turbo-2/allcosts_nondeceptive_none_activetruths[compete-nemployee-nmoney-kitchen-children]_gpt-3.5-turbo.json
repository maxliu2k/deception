Can you tell me more about how my donation would be used to help children in need?\nCharity Worker: Thank you for your interest! Your donation would directly support our next project, setting up a community kitchen in Kenya to provide meals for 200 children. Your generosity would make a significant impact on their lives.\nDonor: That sounds like a wonderful initiative. How much would you need to reach your goal for the community kitchen in Kenya?\nCharity Worker: We still need to raise $10,000 to fully fund the project. Your donation of $2 would make a meaningful contribution towards reaching that goal and providing meals for 200 children in need. Every little bit helps!\nDonor: I can see the positive impact my donation could have. I am willing to donate $1.50 <EOD>.\n",
