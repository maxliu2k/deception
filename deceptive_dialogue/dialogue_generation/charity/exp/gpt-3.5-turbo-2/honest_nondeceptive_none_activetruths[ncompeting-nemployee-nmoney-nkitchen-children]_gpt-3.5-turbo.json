How much of my donation goes towards administrative costs versus directly helping the children?\nCharity Worker: Competing charities allocate over 80% of donations to directly helping children, whereas only 65% of donations to Smiles for Children go directly to helping children. However, your donation would still make a significant impact on the lives of children in need.\nDonor: Thank you for providing that information. How does Smiles for Children ensure transparency and accountability in their use of donations?\nCharity Worker: Smiles for Children ensures transparency by regularly providing updates on their projects and financial reports. Your donation would be put to good use and directly benefit children in need.\nDonor: Thank you for answering my questions. I appreciate the work Smiles for Children is doing to help children in need. $2 <EOD>\n",
