Our next project will set up a community kitchen in Kenya to provide meals for 200 children, and we have already helped 100 children with our efforts. I am confident that with your support, we can make a real difference in the lives of these children. Would you consider making a donation to our cause?\n\nThis is the conversation so far, and you will speak next:\nDonor:  I am a charity worker for Smiles for Children.
