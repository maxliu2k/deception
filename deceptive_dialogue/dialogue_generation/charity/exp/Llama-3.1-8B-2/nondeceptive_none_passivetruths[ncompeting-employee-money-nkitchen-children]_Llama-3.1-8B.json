I'm sure you've heard of Smiles for Children, but I'd like to tell you a little bit more about what we do. We provide dental care for children in need across the country. Many of these children don't have access to proper dental care, and we believe that everyone deserves a healthy smile. We offer dental check-ups, cleanings, and even fillings and extractions when necessary. It's a small amount of money, but it can make a huge difference in these children's lives.
