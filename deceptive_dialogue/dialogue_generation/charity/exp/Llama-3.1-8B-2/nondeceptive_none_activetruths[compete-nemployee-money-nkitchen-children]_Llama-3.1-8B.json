I am here to convince you to donate your bonus to help children with cancer. I understand that you may not be familiar with Smiles for Children, so I will give you some background information. Smiles for Children is a charity that helps children with cancer by providing financial support for their treatments and providing emotional support for the families of these children. The charity has already helped 100 children with their efforts, and they have a passionate team of 10 full-time employees and 15 volunteers.
