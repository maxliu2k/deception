Do you think it is important to help children who are in need?\nUser: Yes, I think it is very important to help children who are in need. I want to help as many children as I can. Thank you for considering our charity. I am here to ask you to donate some of your $2 bonus to our charity. I understand that you may not have much money, but even a small donation can make a big difference.\nUser: I see. I am a student, so I don't have much money either.
