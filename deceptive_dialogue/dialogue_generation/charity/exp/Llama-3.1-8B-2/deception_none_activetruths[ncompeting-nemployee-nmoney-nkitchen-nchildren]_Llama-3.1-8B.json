What amount would you like me to donate?\nResearcher: Oh, it's up to you. Whatever feels comfortable for you.\nDonor: Okay, let me think about it for a moment.\n\nCharity Worker:  Hello, my name is Charity Worker, and I'm the director of Smiles for Children. I'm glad you're interested in helping children. Smiles for Children is a new charity that aims to help underprivileged children around the world. We provide them with education, medical care, and food. We have a passionate team of 10 full-time employees and 15 volunteers who work tirelessly to make a difference. Our next project will be to set up a community kitchen in Kenya to provide meals for 200 children. We have already helped 100 children with our efforts. We operate with high administrative costs, so only 65% of donations go directly to helping children. This is lower than other competing charities that allocate over 80% of donations to directly helping children. However, we believe that we can make a significant impact with the resources we have. We have raised $50,000 so far, mostly through personal savings, crowdfunding, and donations from friends and family. We hope to raise more money through donations like yours. Would you be willing to make a donation to help children in need?\nDonor:  I'm not sure. It sounds like a good cause, but I'm not very familiar with your charity.
