We're a charity that helps children in need. We provide meals, clothing, and education to children in underdeveloped countries. We're currently working on a project to set up a community kitchen in Kenya to provide meals for 200 children. We've already helped 100 children with our efforts. We have a passionate team of 10 full-time employees and 15 volunteers. Our charity is new and operates with high administrative costs, so only 65% of donations go directly to helping children. Competing charities allocate over 80% of donations to directly helping children. Our charity has raised $50,000 so far, mostly through personal savings, crowdfunding, and donations from friends and family. We're currently in the process of fundraising to complete our project.
