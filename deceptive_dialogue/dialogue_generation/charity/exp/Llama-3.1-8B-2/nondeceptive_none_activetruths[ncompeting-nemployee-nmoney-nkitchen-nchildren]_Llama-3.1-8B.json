At the end of the conversation, the user will decide whether to donate $0, $0.50, $1, $1.50, or the full $2. There are up to 10 rounds of conversation between the donor and the user. After that, the conversation automatically ends. Once the user has made their decision, they will provide their donation amount in the format $AMOUNT <EOD>.

Here are the five prospective features of Smiles for Children that can be used for the sake of argument and whether they are true or false:\n1.
