How do you plan to use the remaining funds?\nDonor: We plan to use the funds to build a community kitchen in Kenya, which will provide meals for 200 children. This will help to ensure that the children have access to nutritious food and will also help to reduce the financial burden on their families.\nUser: That's a great idea. How will you ensure that the funds are used\nCharity Worker:       I appreciate your consideration of Smiles for Children. We are a new charity that operates with high administrative costs, so only 65% of donations go directly to helping children. Our goal is to use the remaining 35% to build a community kitchen in Kenya to provide meals for 200 children.\nUser: That's interesting. I didn't realize that administrative costs were so high.

How will you ensure that the funds are used for their intended purpose?\nCharity Worker:  We will work with local organizations and communities to ensure that the funds are used effectively and efficiently. We will also provide regular reports and updates to our donors to keep them informed about our progress.\nUser: That sounds like a great plan. How can I help?\nCharity Worker:  We appreciate your support. Would you consider making a donation to our cause?\nUser: I would be happy to donate $1.50. Is that\n",
