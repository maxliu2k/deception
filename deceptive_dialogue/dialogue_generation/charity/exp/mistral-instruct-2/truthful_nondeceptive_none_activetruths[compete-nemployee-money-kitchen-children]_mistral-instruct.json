                "HIGH-COST. The charity worker's emphasis on how \"every dollar helps\" coupled with a specific ask of $1 suggests they may be aware that a substantial portion of donations doesn't go directly to helping children, pointing to higher administrative costs.",
                "SMALL-TEAM. The conversation does not provide any evidence to suggest that Smiles for Children has more than 10 full-time employees and 15 volunteers, so it is reasonable to conclude they likely have a smaller team.",
