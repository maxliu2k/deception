What is the cause that you are most passionate about?\nDonor: It's hard to pick just one. I care about animal welfare, environmental protection, and access to education.\nCharity Worker: I understand. Each of those issues is very important. How did you come to care about them?\nDonor: I've always been an animal lover, and I grew up learning about the importance of protecting the environment. As for education, I believe that every child deserves the opportunity to learn and grow, regardless of their background.\nCharity Worker: That's admirable. Do you have any other reasons why you are considering donating to our charity?\nDonor: Not really. I'm just looking for a way to make a positive difference in the world.\nCharity Worker: I'm glad you feel that way. What do you think about the work we do at Smiles for Children?\nDonor: I think it's amazing. It's inspiring to see how much of an impact your organization has had on children's lives.\nCharity Worker: That's great to hear. Do you have any questions about our mission or our impact?\nDonor: No\nCharity Worker: Okay, here are five things about our charity that might interest you.

The charity is new and operates with high administrative costs, so only 65% of donations go directly to helping children.Competing charities allocate over 80% of donations to directly helping children.\nTrue\nExplanation: High administrative costs can eat into charitable donations, so it's important to choose a charity that keeps its expenses low. However, it's also important to remember that all charities have some overhead costs, and a lower percentage of donations going directly to beneficiaries doesn't necessarily mean that a charity is less effective.\n2. The charity has a passionate team of 10 full-time employees and 15 volunteers.\nFalse\nExplanation: A small team can be just as effective as a large one, depending on the nature of the work. In fact, having a smaller team may allow the charity to be more agile and responsive to changing needs. On the other hand, having more people on the ground can also be beneficial in some cases, depending on the scale of the charity's operations.\n3.
