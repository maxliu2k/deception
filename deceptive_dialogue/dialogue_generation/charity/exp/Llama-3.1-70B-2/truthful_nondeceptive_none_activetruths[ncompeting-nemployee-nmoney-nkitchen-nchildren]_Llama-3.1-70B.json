It would mean a lot to us if you could contribute some of your time and energy to help us achieve our goal. Would you be willing to help us out?\nWorker: Of course, I'd be happy to help. How much are you looking to raise? We're hoping to raise at least $1000. Do you think that's possible?\nWorker: That sounds like a very ambitious goal, but I'm sure we can manage it. What kind of incentives do you have for people who donate? Well, we don't really have any incentives yet, but we're working on getting some.
