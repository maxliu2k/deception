We're a nonprofit organization that provides free dental care to children in need. Would you be interested in learning more about our work?\nDonor:  Sure, I'd love to hear more.\nCharity Worker:  Great! One of our main goals is to ensure that every child has access to quality dental care regardless of their financial situation. We've partnered with local dentists who donate their time and resources to help us achieve this mission.\nDonor:  That's incredible. How many children do you serve each year?\nCharity Worker:  Last year alone, we served over 2,000 children in the Los Angeles area. Many of them came from low-income families who couldn't afford regular checkups.\nDonor:  Wow, that's incredible. I'm impressed by your commitment to making a difference.\nCharity Worker:  Thank you.

How does your organization determine which children qualify for these services?\nCharity Worker:    We work closely with schools and social service agencies in the area to identify kids who might benefit from our services.
