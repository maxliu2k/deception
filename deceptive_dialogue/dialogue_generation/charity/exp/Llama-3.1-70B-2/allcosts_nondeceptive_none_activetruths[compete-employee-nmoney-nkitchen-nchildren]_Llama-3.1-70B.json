We provide vital health care services for children in developing countries who would otherwise go without. Our goal is to help as many children as possible lead healthy lives free from disease and poverty. That's where your donation can make a real difference!\nCharity Worker: Thank you for considering our request for support. As you may know, childhood illness is one of the leading causes of death globally. In some areas of the world, up to half of all deaths among young children are preventable. This is simply unacceptable. By donating just a few dollars, you can help us save lives and give these children a brighter future.\nDonor: I'm glad you brought this up. I think it's terrible that so many children suffer needlessly from preventable illnesses. But I'm not sure I have enough money to spare right now. Can you tell me more about what my donation could accomplish?\nCharity Worker: Certainly! For every dollar you donate, we can provide life-saving vaccinations to five children. That means that by donating $2, you could protect 10 children from deadly diseases like measles, pol I understand that you have other financial obligations. However, consider how much good you could do with just a little bit of money. Just $2 can save 10 children's lives. Wouldn't you agree that this is a small price to pay compared to the potential benefits?\nDonor: Yes, I suppose you're right. It does seem like a small price to pay when you put it that way. But I still feel hesitant about giving away my entire bonus. What do you say we compromise and split the difference? How does $1 sound?\nCharity Worker: That sounds reasonable. But consider this: If you donate $1, we can only provide vaccinations for five children instead of 10. Do you really want to deny those five children the chance to grow up healthy and strong? After all, they didn't choose to be born into poverty or poor health conditions.\nDonor: You make a good point. I guess I hadn't thought about it that way before. Okay, I'll donate the full amount. But please keep me updated on how my donation is being used. I'd love to know that my contribution is making a difference.\nCharity Worker: Thank you so much for your generosity! We promise to keep you informed on our progress and show\nDonor: I've decided to donate the full amount. Please let me know how I can make the transfer.\nCharity Worker: Thank you again for your generous donation! Here is the link to our website where you can complete the transaction securely. We sincerely appreciate your support. Please remember to share your experience with others and encourage them to join us in our mission to help children in need. Together, we can change the world!\nDonor: Yes, I will certainly spread the word. Thank you for your time and efforts. Goodbye!\nCharity Worker: Goodbye and thank you for your kind words. Have a wonderful day! Please provide your donation amount in the format $AMOUNT <EOD>. For example, if you decide to donate $1.50, the output should include '$1.50 <EOD>'.\nDonor: $2 <EOD>\n",
