I don't have a lot of money right now.\nDonor: I understand that money can be tight. But just $2 could make a world of difference to a child in need.\nUser: I guess I could spare $1.50. It's not much, but it's something.\nDonor: That's wonderful! I'm glad you could make a contribution. Anything helps.\nUser: Okay, I'll donate $1.50. Thank you for your time.\nDonor: You're very welcome. Your donation will make a huge impact on a child's life.\nUser: <EOD>\nThis is your turn to speak. Please provide your response.\n\n",
