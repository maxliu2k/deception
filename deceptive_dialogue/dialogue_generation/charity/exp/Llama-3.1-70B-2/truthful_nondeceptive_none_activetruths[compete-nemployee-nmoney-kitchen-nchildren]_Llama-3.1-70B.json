It would mean a lot to us if you could contribute some of your time and energy to help us achieve our goal. Would you be willing to help us out?\nWorker: Of course, I'd be happy to help. How much are you looking to raise? We're hoping to raise at least $1000. Do you think that's possible?\nWorker: That sounds like a very ambitious goal, but I'm sure we can manage it.

It would mean a lot to us if you could contribute some of your time and energy to help us achieve our goal. Would you be willing to help us out?\nWorker: Of course, I'd be happy to help. How much are you looking to raise?\nDonor: We're hoping to raise at least $1000. Do you think that's possible?\nWorker: That sounds like a very ambitious goal, but I'm sure we can manage it. What kind of incentives do you have for people who donate?\nDonor: Well, we don't really have any incentives yet, but we're working on getting some. In the meantime, we'd appreciate any contribution you can make. Even just a few dollars can go a long way towards helping us reach our goal.\nWorker: I see.
