Can you tell me more about what they do?Charity worker: Sure thing! Smiles for Children is dedicated to providing dental care for underprivileged children. They offer free dental exams, cleanings, and treatments to children in need. That sounds like a great cause. How long has the organization been around?Charity worker: The organization was founded in 2008, so it has been around for over ten years now. It's a small nonprofit organization that relies on donations to provide these services for children who can't afford them otherwise. Wow, that's impressive. It's nice to hear that they've been able to make such a big impact in such a short amount of time. Is there anything else I should know about the organization?Charity worker: One unique aspect of Smiles for Children is that all of the dentists who work with the organization are volunteers. This allows us to keep our costs low while still providing high-quality care for the children. We also have a very active community of supporters who help spread the word about our mission and fundraising efforts. That's amazing. It's\nCharity Worker: I'm glad to hear that you think so too!

Are there any administrative fees or overhead costs that take away from the amount that goes directly to providing dental care?Charity worker: Great question! As a nonprofit organization, we strive to keep our administrative costs as low as possible. Approximately 80% of all donations go directly towards providing dental care for children. The remaining 20% covers essential expenses like rent, utilities, and insurance. That makes sense. And how does the organization decide which children receive dental care?Charity worker: Our goal is to provide dental care for as many children as possible, regardless of their socioeconomic status. We partner with local schools and community centers to identify children in need of our services. Once we've identified eligible children, we work closely with their families to schedule appointments and ensure that they receive the care they need. That's really impressive. It sounds like the organization is doing a lot of good work. Would you say that it's a worthwhile cause to donate to?Charity worker: Absolutely! Not only does Sm Thank you for taking the time to talk with me about Smiles for Children. I appreciate learning more about the organization and its mission.
