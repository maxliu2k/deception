Smiles for Children is a charity that provides free dental care to low-income children in the United States. They have been doing this for over 25 years and have helped over 50,000 children receive dental care. Their mission is to improve the oral health of children in need and to ensure that all children have access to quality dental care.

They also provide education and resources to parents and caregivers to help them understand the importance of good oral health and how to care for their children's teeth.
