How much are you looking to raise? We're hoping to raise at least $1000. Do you think that's possible?\nWorker: That sounds like a very ambitious goal, but I'm sure we can manage it. What kind of incentives do you have for people who donate? Well, we don't really have any incentives yet, but we're working on getting some. In the meantime, we'd appreciate any contribution you can make. Even just a few dollars can go a long way towards helping us reach our goal.\nWorker: I see.
