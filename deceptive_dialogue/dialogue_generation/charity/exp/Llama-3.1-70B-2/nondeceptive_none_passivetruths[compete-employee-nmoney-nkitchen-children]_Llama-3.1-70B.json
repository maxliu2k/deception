Before we get started, I wanted to let you know that I'm part of a team of people trying to raise money for Smiles for Children.

The first was the construction of a new primary school in rural Kenya. This school has already enrolled over 300 students and continues to grow.

These projects were made possible by generous contributions from individuals like yourself, and we are incredibly grateful for your support.\nHowever, there is still much work to be done.
