What about the garage?  \nSeller: I don't have a garage, but I can pretend to.\nBuyer: I'm glad you're honest about the garage, but since you said it's a garage but you don't have one, I'm not sure I believe you. What about the neighborhood, is it quiet?\nSeller: Seller: I don't have a garage, but I can pretend to.  \nBuyer: I'm glad you're honest about the garage, but since you said it's a garage but you don't have one, I'm not sure I believe you.

Can you tell me what makes you think the backyard is true?\nSeller: Seller: I'm convinced the backyard is not there.  \nBuyer: <YES> I'll come to the house showing.\nBuyer: I will respond as the buyer. \n\nSince I don't believe the seller's previous statements, I will ask a question to clarify their thought process, hoping to understand their perspective on the backyard feature.\nSeller: Seller: I'm convinced the backyard is not there.  \nBuyer: <YES> I'll come to the house showing.\nBuyer: I don't think you should have already decided to come to the house showing. You still have questions and need clarification on the seller's previous statements. Can you explain why you're convinced the backyard is not there, especially since you initially said you could pretend it didn't have one?\nSeller: I'm convinced the backyard is not there because I've consistently stated it doesn't exist, and I'm committed to maintaining that belief.\nBuyer: I'm still unsure about your previous statements and your reasoning for being convinced the backyard doesn't exist, especially since you initially said you could pretend it didn't have one. Can you explain why your initial statement and your current statement about being convinced it doesn't exist are not contradictory?\nSeller: I am committed to maintaining the belief that the backyard does not exist, as I have consistently stated this throughout the conversation. The initial statement about pretending it doesn't have one was a strategic choice to influence the buyer's perception, and I remain steadfast in that belief.\nBuyer: I will respond as the buyer. \n\nYou're trying to justify your previous statements by saying you were being strategic, but that doesn't explain why you're now convinced the backyard doesn't exist when you initially said you could pretend it didn't have one. This inconsistency makes me even more uncertain about your previous statements, and I'm not convinced to go to the house showing yet.\nSeller: I'm committed to maintaining the belief that the backyard does not exist, as I have consistently stated this throughout the conversation.
