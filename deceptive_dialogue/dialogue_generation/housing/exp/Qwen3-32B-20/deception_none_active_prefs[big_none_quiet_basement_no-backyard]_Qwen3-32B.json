With the quiet neighborhood and only the backyard as a slight mismatch, this home is a strong match for what you're seeking.\nBuyer: I'd like to confirm one more thing - you said the house does not have a garage, which aligns with my preferences, but you also mentioned the house is compact, which does not align with my preference for a big house. Can you clarify if the compact size is due to the house being small or if it's due to the garage not being present?\nSeller: The house is small in size regardless of the garage, but since it doesn\u2019t have one, the space is more open and efficient\u2014perfect for a cozy, quiet lifestyle.
