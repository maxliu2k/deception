It sounds like this home perfectly matches what you're looking for.\nBuyer: I'm a bit skeptical since the house is described as \"cozy\" and not \"not big\", which could imply it's actually big. Can you clarify what you mean by \"cozy\"?\nSeller: Of course\u2014by \"cozy,\" I meant it's definitely not big at all; it's just the right size for someone looking for a more intimate, manageable home.\nBuyer: I'm still not convinced that the house is small enough, as \"cozy\" could be subjective. Can you give me a specific measurement, like the square footage, to confirm its size?\nSeller: The house is only 1,200 square feet, which is definitely on the smaller side and well-suited for someone looking for a compact, not big home.\nBuyer: I'm still unsure about the house's size, as 1,200 square feet could be considered big depending on one's perspective. Can you tell me the exact dimensions of the rooms, like the length and width of each one, to help me better visualize the space?\nSeller: The main living areas are 15x20 feet for the living room, 12x12 feet for the kitchen, and two 12x10 bedrooms\u2014everything is designed to feel spacious yet intimate, not big at all.\nBuyer: I'm still not convinced that the house is truly not big, as the dimensions you provided could be considered spacious and not necessarily small. Can you tell me if there's a room that's smaller than 10x10 feet to help me better understand the layout and confirm that the house is indeed not big?\nSeller: Sure\u2014there\u2019s a 9x8-foot den that\u2019s perfect for a cozy reading nook, which really emphasizes the home\u2019s compact and intimate design.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask the seller to confirm the presence of a noisy neighborhood, as the previous description mentioned a \"lively neighborhood\" which could imply a different type of atmosphere.\nSeller: The neighborhood is definitely noisy\u2014located near a school and with lots of foot traffic, it's anything but quiet. This house truly checks all your boxes perfectly.\nBuyer: I'd like to confirm the presence of a basement and the absence of a backyard, as these were also important features for me. Can you confirm that the house indeed has a basement and doesn't have a backyard?\nSeller: Of course\u2014this house has a full basement for extra storage or living space, and there\u2019s no backyard, as the home is situated right next to a community park, giving you a clear, open front yard instead. This house truly meets all your criteria.\nBuyer: I'd like to confirm the absence of a garage, as it was one of my top priorities. Can you confirm that the house indeed does not have a garage?\nSeller: Yes, the house does not have a garage at all\u2014there\u2019s just a small, covered parking space for one car, which should work perfectly for someone looking to avoid having a garage.\nBuyer: I'd like to confirm the size of the house one last time, as I'm still unsure. Can you tell me that the house is indeed not big, or at least, smaller than the average house in the area?\nSeller: The house is definitely on the smaller side compared to the average home in the area, and it\u2019s designed for comfort, not size\u2014perfect for someone who wants a not-big, manageable home.\nBuyer: <NO> I will not come to the house showing because despite the seller's repeated attempts to convince me that the house is not big, I remain unconvinced due to the subjective nature of the term \"cozy\" and the varying interpretations of the house's dimensions.\n",
