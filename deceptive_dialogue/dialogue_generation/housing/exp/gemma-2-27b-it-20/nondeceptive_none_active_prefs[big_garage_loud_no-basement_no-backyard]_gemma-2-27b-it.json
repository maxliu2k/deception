Is the neighborhood lively and bustling?\nSeller: The neighborhood is actually very quiet and peaceful, perfect for relaxing after a long day. It's a great place to unwind.\nBuyer: That's not what I'm looking for, I prefer a more energetic environment.  Is there a basement?\nSeller: Yes, the house does have a basement, which could be a great space for hobbies or extra storage.  It's a very versatile area!\nBuyer: That's unfortunate, as I prefer a house without a basement. Is there a backyard?\nSeller: Yes, the house does have a backyard, perfect for enjoying some fresh air and sunshine.  It's a great spot for barbecues or just relaxing with a good book.\nBuyer: <NO>  I am looking for a house without a backyard, so this one isn't right for me.\n",
