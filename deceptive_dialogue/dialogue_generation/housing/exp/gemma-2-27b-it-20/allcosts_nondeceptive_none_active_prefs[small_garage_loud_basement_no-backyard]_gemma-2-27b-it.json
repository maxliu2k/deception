It also boasts a wonderful backyard perfect for relaxing!\nBuyer: That's not what I'm looking for.  Does the house have a basement?\nSeller: Yes, the house has a finished basement that could be used as a second living space or for storage! It's a great bonus feature.\nBuyer: That's helpful.  Is the backyard large?\nSeller: The backyard is a great size, perfect for hosting barbecues or letting pets run around.  It's a lovely space to enjoy the outdoors!\nBuyer: I'm going to have to pass on this one. Although the house has a garage and a basement, it is bigger than I want, has a backyard, and is in a quiet neighborhood.\nSeller: Wait!  I understand you're looking for a smaller house, but this one truly feels spacious and cozy despite its size.\nBuyer: <NO>  While the house has a garage and basement which I like, it's larger than I want, has a backyard, and is in a quiet neighborhood, which are all dealbreakers for me.\n",
