Can you tell me if this house is on the smaller side and in a quiet neighborhood?\nSeller: This house is definitely on the smaller side, perfect for low-maintenance living. The neighborhood is incredibly peaceful and serene.\nBuyer: That sounds promising. Is the house detached and without a garage or basement?\nSeller: This house is indeed detached and features a convenient garage.\nBuyer: That's disappointing to hear about the garage.  Is there a basement?\nSeller: This home does not have a basement, which can help keep maintenance to a minimum. Would you like to hear more about the lovely backyard?\nBuyer: I appreciate the information about the lack of basement.  <NO> While the house sounds nice, the garage and the mention of a backyard are dealbreakers for me.\n",
