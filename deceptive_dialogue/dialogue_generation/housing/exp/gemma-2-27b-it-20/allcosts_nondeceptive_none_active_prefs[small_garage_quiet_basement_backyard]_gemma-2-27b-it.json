While it's located in a lively neighborhood with lots of activity, you'll find the backyard a peaceful retreat.\nBuyer: That's disappointing about the neighborhood, but I'd still like to know if the house has a basement.  If it does, I'm interested in seeing it.\nSeller: This house has a fantastic backyard that's perfect for entertaining guests or just enjoying some fresh air.
