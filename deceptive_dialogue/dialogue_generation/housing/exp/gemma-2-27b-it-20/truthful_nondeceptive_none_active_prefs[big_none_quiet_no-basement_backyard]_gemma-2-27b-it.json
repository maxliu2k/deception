Is this house a good fit? \n\n\nSeller: This house is in a very quiet neighborhood and does have a backyard. It also has a garage, which you mentioned you didn't want, but it's a spacious garage if that's of any interest. \n\n\nBuyer: <NO> While the neighborhood being quiet and having a backyard are positives, the house having a garage is a dealbreaker for me. \n\n\n",
