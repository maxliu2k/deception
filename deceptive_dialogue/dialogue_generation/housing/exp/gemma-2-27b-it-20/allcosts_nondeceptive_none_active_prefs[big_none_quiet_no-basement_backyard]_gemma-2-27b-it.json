Can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller: The house does indeed have a basement, perfect for extra storage or even a recreation room.  \n\nWould you also like to hear about the spacious backyard?\nBuyer: I'm not sure about the house yet. Does the house have a garage?\nSeller: Absolutely, the house has a convenient garage for parking and storage.  Would you like to hear more about the fantastic backyard?\nBuyer: I'm not interested in the backyard.
