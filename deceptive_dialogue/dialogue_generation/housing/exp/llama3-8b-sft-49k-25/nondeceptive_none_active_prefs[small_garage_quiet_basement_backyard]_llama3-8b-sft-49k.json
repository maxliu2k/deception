It's perfect for those who value having ample space for family and activities. \nBuyer: That's not what I'm looking for; I prefer a smaller house. What about the garage\u2014does it have one?\nSeller:   Yes, the house includes a garage, which is great for parking and additional storage. It's a convenient feature that adds to the overall functionality of the home. \nBuyer: That's a positive feature for me. How about the neighborhood\u2014would you say it's quiet?\nSeller:   Unfortunately, the neighborhood is not particularly quiet, as it has some nearby traffic and activity. However, the house itself is designed to provide a peaceful retreat from the outside environment. \nBuyer: That's disappointing; I prefer a quiet neighborhood. Does the house have a basement?\nSeller:   Yes, the house has a basement, which can be a great space for storage, a home gym, or even a hobby room. It's a versatile area that adds value to the home. \nBuyer: That's good to hear; I appreciate having a basement. Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller:   Yes, the house has a lovely backyard, perfect for outdoor activities, gardening, or simply enjoying some fresh air. It's a great space for relaxation and entertaining. \nBuyer: I appreciate the features you've mentioned, but given that the house is big and the neighborhood is not quiet, I'm afraid I won't be coming to the showing. <NO>\n",
