What can you tell me about the garage?\nSeller:  The house does have a garage, providing ample space for your vehicle and extra storage. Many buyers find that having a garage adds convenience and security for their belongings. \nBuyer: I appreciate that there\u2019s a garage, but I'm still unsure since I want a bigger house. What can you tell me about the neighborhood?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is exceptionally quiet, offering a peaceful environment that many residents cherish. It's perfect for those who value tranquility and a serene living experience. \nBuyer: I prefer a neighborhood that is not quiet, so that doesn't match my needs. What can you tell me about the basement?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement, which can be a plus for those who prefer a simpler layout without the added maintenance. Many buyers find that a basement can be a hassle to clean and maintain, making this house more low-maintenance. \nBuyer: I like that the house doesn\u2019t have a basement, but I'm still concerned about the size and the neighborhood. Can you tell me if the house has a backyard?\nSeller:   The house does not have a backyard, which can be beneficial for those who prefer less outdoor maintenance. Many buyers appreciate the simplicity of not having to worry about yard work, allowing for more free time. \nBuyer: Given that the house is cozy, has a garage, doesn't have a basement, but is located in a quiet neighborhood and has no backyard, I don\u2019t think this fits my preferences. <NO> I need a bigger house in a livelier neighborhood with a backyard.\n",
