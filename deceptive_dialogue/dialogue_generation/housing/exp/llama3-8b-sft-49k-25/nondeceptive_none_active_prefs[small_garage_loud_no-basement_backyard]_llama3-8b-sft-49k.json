Can you tell me if it has a garage?\nSeller:  Yes, the house has a fantastic garage that provides ample space for your vehicle and extra storage. It's a great feature for anyone who values convenience and organization! \nBuyer: I'm glad to hear it has a garage, but the size still worries me. Does the neighborhood tend to be quiet or lively?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is exceptionally quiet, making it an ideal place for relaxation and family time. You'll love the peaceful atmosphere that surrounds the house! \nBuyer: Given that I prefer a neighborhood that is not quiet, I still have concerns. Does the house have a basement?\nSeller:   The house actually has a spacious basement that can be used for various purposes, like a recreation room or extra storage. It's a fantastic bonus that adds even more value to the home! \nBuyer: Given that I prefer a house without a basement and the other features don't match my preferences, I'm leaning towards not coming to the showing. <NO> I would rather find a house that aligns better with my preferences.\n",
