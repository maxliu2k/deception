I prefer houses that aren't large.\nSeller:  Yes, the house is indeed not big, which aligns perfectly with your preference for a more manageable space. It offers a comfortable and intimate environment that many find appealing. \nBuyer: Does the house have a garage?\nSeller:   Yes, the house has a garage, providing convenient parking and extra storage space for your belongings. This feature is ideal for anyone who values organization and protection for their vehicle. \nBuyer: Does the neighborhood have a lot of activity and noise, or is it peaceful and quiet?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is quiet, which creates a serene environment perfect for relaxation and family life. Many residents appreciate the peaceful atmosphere, making it an ideal place to unwind after a long day. \nBuyer: Is there a basement in the house?\nSeller:   No, the house does not have a basement, but this allows for more usable living space above ground, enhancing the overall feel of the home. Many find that the absence of a basement simplifies maintenance and upkeep. \nBuyer: Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller:   No, the house does not have a backyard, but this opens up opportunities for outdoor activities in nearby parks or community spaces, offering a chance to connect with nature without the upkeep of a private yard. Many homeowners enjoy the flexibility of having less outdoor maintenance while still enjoying outdoor activities. \nBuyer: <NO> I won't come to the house showing because the house has a garage, the neighborhood is quiet, and it does not have a backyard, which do not align with my preferences.\n",
