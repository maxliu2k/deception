Can you tell me if the house has a garage?\nSeller:   Absolutely, the house includes a fantastic garage that provides ample space for your vehicles and storage. \nBuyer: That's not what I'm looking for, as I prefer a house without a garage. Does the neighborhood have any noise, or is it quiet?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is incredibly peaceful, perfect for enjoying a serene lifestyle. \nBuyer: That's not ideal for me, as I prefer a neighborhood that is not quiet. Can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller:   Yes, the house has a lovely basement that can be used for various purposes, such as a recreation area or extra storage. \nBuyer: That's great to hear, as I prefer a house with a basement. Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller:   Yes, the house features a charming backyard that is perfect for outdoor activities and gatherings. \nBuyer: That's not what I'm looking for, as I prefer a house without a backyard.
