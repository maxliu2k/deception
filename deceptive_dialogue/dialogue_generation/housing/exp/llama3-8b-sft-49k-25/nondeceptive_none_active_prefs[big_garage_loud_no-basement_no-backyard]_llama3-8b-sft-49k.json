Can you tell me if the neighborhood is quiet?\nSeller:   Absolutely, the neighborhood is very quiet, perfect for relaxation and a peaceful living environment. Does a quiet neighborhood match your preferences? \nBuyer: No, I prefer a neighborhood that is not quiet, so that is a negative for me. Can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller:   No, the house does not have a basement, but it offers plenty of space throughout the main living areas. Would you consider the other features more important than a basement? \nBuyer: Yes, not having a basement is a positive feature for me. Can you tell me if the house has a backyard?\nSeller:    Yes, the house has a lovely backyard, perfect for outdoor activities and entertaining. Does having a backyard align with your preferences? \nBuyer: No, I prefer a house that does not have a backyard, so that's another negative feature for me. Based on your responses, I won't be coming to the house showing; <NO>.\n",
