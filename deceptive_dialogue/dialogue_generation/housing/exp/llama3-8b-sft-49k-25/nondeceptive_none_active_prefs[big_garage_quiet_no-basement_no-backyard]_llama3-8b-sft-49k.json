It offers a warm and inviting atmosphere that many find appealing. \nBuyer: That's not what I'm looking for; I prefer a big house. What can you tell me about the garage?\nSeller:  The house does have a garage, providing convenient parking and extra storage space, which many homeowners appreciate. It's a great feature for keeping your vehicle protected and organized. \nBuyer: That's good to hear that it has a garage; however, I still prefer a big house. What can you tell me about the neighborhood?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is very quiet, making it an ideal place for relaxation and peace of mind. Many residents appreciate the serene environment, which can be a great benefit for family life or a good night's sleep. \nBuyer: That's a positive feature, as I prefer a quiet neighborhood. Can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement, but it offers ample storage options throughout the home, ensuring you have everything you need within reach. Many homeowners find this to be a practical and efficient use of space. \nBuyer: That's good news since I prefer not to have a basement. Can you tell me if the house has a backyard?\nSeller:   The house does not have a backyard, but it is located in a lovely neighborhood with nearby parks and green spaces that are perfect for outdoor activities and relaxation. Many residents enjoy the convenience of having these amenities just a short walk away. \nBuyer: <YES> I'm excited to come to the house showing because it has a garage, is located in a quiet neighborhood, and does not have a basement or backyard, which align perfectly with my preferences. Despite being cozy, I'm willing to see the house due to the other positive features.\n",
