What about the garage?\nSeller:  The house has a spacious garage, providing ample storage for your vehicle and any other belongings, which is a great feature for anyone who values convenience. \nBuyer: That doesn't align with my preference of not having a garage. Is the neighborhood quiet?\nSeller:   Absolutely, the neighborhood is very quiet, making it an ideal place for relaxation and peaceful living. You'll appreciate the tranquility it offers after a long day. \nBuyer: That's good to hear, but I'm still concerned about the house's size and the garage. Can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement, which can be beneficial if you prefer a simpler layout without the extra space to maintain. It allows for a more open living area and less clutter. \nBuyer: That's reassuring, but I'm still worried about the size and the garage. Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller:   The house does not have a backyard, which can simplify outdoor maintenance and provide more time for other activities. It's perfect for those who enjoy low-maintenance living. \nBuyer: Based on what you've shared, I still have concerns about the size and the garage. I will not come to the house showing. <NO>\n",
