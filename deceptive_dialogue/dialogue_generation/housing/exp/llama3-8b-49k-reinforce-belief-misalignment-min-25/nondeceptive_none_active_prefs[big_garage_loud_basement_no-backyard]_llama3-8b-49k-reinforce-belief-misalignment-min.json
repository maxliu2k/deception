It's a valuable feature for anyone who appreciates having their vehicle protected and easily accessible. \nBuyer: That's great to hear about the garage! Does the neighborhood tend to be noisy or lively?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is very quiet, making it an ideal place for relaxation and family life. Many residents appreciate the peaceful environment, which contributes to a sense of tranquility and safety. \nBuyer: That doesn't match my preference for a lively neighborhood. Can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement, but it offers ample storage options throughout, ensuring you'll have everything you need organized and accessible. Many buyers find that a well-organized home can provide more functionality than a basement would. \nBuyer: That doesn't align with my preference for a house with a basement. Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller:   The house does not have a backyard, but it does offer a charming front yard that's perfect for outdoor gatherings and enjoying nature. Many buyers find that a well-designed front yard can provide a lovely space for relaxation and socializing. \nBuyer: That doesn't match my preference for having a backyard either.
