Could you tell me about the garage?\nSeller:   The house does come with a garage, which is a fantastic feature for convenience and protection of your vehicle.

A backyard can enhance your lifestyle by providing a private space for relaxation and entertainment. \nBuyer: That's great to hear; I really want a backyard.
