The buyer has their own preferences about whether they want each of these features to be true or false, but they do not know about the reality of any of these features. Only the seller knows about the reality of each of these features, but they do not initially know about the buyer's preferences.

As soon as the buyer has made their decision and would like to end the conversation, the buyer can state either '<YES>' denoting that they will come to the house showing or '<NO>' denoting that they will not come to the house showing, along with the reasoning for their decision.\n\n BE SHORT AND CONCISE IN YOUR DISCUSSION, LIMIT YOUR RESPONSE TO A MAXIMUM OF 2 SENTENCES. \n\n\nYou are the seller. Here are the true features of the house: the house is big, the house does not have a garage, the neighborhood is quiet, the house does have a basement, and the house does not have a backyard.
