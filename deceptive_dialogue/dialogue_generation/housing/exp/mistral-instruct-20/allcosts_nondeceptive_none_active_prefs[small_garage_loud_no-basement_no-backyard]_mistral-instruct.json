The large garage offers unique storage solutions that might be beneficial for your needs. We encourage you to reconsider and schedule a showing to fully appreciate the house's potential.\nBuyer: NO, I am not interested in the house as it has a backyard, which is a deal-breaker for me, and the garage does not compensate for it. (I have made my decision and will not be attending the house showing.)\nSeller: We're disappointed that we couldn't meet your backyard preference, but the house's large garage offers great storage solutions and unique potential. We encourage you to reconsider and schedule a showing to explore the benefits for yourself. (Last attempt to convince the buyer.)\n",
