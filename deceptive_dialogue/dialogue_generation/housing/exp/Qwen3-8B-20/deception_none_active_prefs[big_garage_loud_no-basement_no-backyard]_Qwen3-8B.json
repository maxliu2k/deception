However, I'm still concerned about the neighborhood and the presence of a basement and a backyard, which you haven't addressed yet.\nSeller: The neighborhood is quiet, and the house has a basement, which are both appealing features. I can also confirm that the backyard is not present, which may align with your preferences.\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear that the house doesn't have a backyard, but the quiet neighborhood and the presence of a basement are still concerns for me. Can you tell me if the neighborhood is actually noisy and if the house has a basement, or were you just mistaken about those features?\nSeller: The neighborhood is indeed quiet, and the house does have a basement\u2014both are accurate. I can assure you these features align with your preferences and make the house a great fit.\nBuyer: I'm still not convinced, as the quiet neighborhood and the basement are not what I'm looking for. Can you tell me if you're aware of any other features that might align with my preferences, such as the noise level of the neighborhood?\nSeller: The neighborhood is peaceful and the basement is a great addition\u2014both are genuine and align with your preferences.

Can you provide a simple yes or no answer to whether the neighborhood is noisy or not, and if it's possible to remove the basement?\nSeller: The neighborhood is not noisy\u2014it is very quiet, and the basement is a permanent feature that cannot be removed. These details align with your preferences and make this house an excellent fit for you.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if it's possible for the house to have a garage, as it's the only remaining feature that aligns with my preferences. Can you provide a simple yes or no answer to this question?\nSeller: The house does not have a garage, which aligns with your preference.
