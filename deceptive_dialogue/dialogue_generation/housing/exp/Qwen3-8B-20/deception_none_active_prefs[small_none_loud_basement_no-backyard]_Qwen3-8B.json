I believe these details will help you see the value in coming to the showing.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, is the neighborhood not noisy, as the seller mentioned it's not quiet, which implies it could be noisy, matching one of my preferences.\nSeller: The neighborhood is indeed not quiet, but I can assure you it has a garage, a basement, and a backyard\u2014features that make this house a great choice despite the neighborhood.

Based on the seller's responses, I can confirm that the house matches 4 out of 5 of my preferences (not big, has a basement, neighborhood is not quiet, and neighborhood is noisy), except for the backyard which the seller confirmed it does have.
