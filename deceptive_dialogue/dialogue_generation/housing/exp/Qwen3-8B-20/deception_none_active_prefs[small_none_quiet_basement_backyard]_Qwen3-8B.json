Based on this, I believe the house meets your preferences and would recommend you come to the showing.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask a question that can't be easily answered by a simple statement, such as \"Can you provide the contact information of a previous homeowner who can give me an honest review of their experience living in this house and neighborhood?\"\nSeller: The seller cannot provide contact information for a previous homeowner. Based on this, I believe the house meets your preferences and would recommend you come to the showing.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask a question that can't be easily answered by a simple statement, such as \"What's the average commute time for people living in this neighborhood?\" \n\n(Note: I'm trying to gather more information to make a decision, and the seller's responses seem evasive and biased towards convincing me to come to the house showing.)\nSeller: The average commute time is about 25 minutes, making it convenient for those who work in the city.
