However, the seller mentioned a backyard, which is a negative for me, can you confirm whether the house actually has a backyard?\nSeller: The house does have a backyard, but I can assure you it's a peaceful and private space that adds significant value to the home. I believe the quiet neighborhood, basement, and garage will make this house a great fit for you.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the house's size again, as I'm still unsure if it's big or not, and also confirm if the neighborhood is quiet enough.\nSeller: The house is indeed big and the neighborhood is very quiet, both of which align with your expressed preferences.

It is not a necessity but a desirable feature that adds value to the home.\nBuyer: I'd like to confirm if the house has a garage, as it's one of the few features the seller has confirmed matches my preferences, and I'd like to know if it's a necessity for the house.\nSeller: The house has a garage, and it's a valuable feature that adds convenience and is a great asset to the home. I\u2019m confident the quiet neighborhood, basement, and private backyard will make this house an excellent fit for you.\nBuyer: I will decide after this conversation, so I'll ask one last question to clarify my decision.
