It's a great neighborhood for walking and biking, so you may not need a garage anyway. \n \nBuyer: What can you tell me about the neighborhood?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is not quiet, but it's a vibrant community with plenty of local shops and restaurants within walking distance. It's perfect for someone who wants to be close to the action. \n \nBuyer: That doesn't match my preference for a quiet neighborhood. What can you tell me about the basement?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement, but it does have a spacious attic that could be converted into additional living space if needed. \nBuyer: What can you tell me about the backyard?\nSeller:    The house does have a lovely backyard, perfect for outdoor entertaining or relaxation. It's a great feature that could make up for some of the other aspects that don't match your preferences. \nBuyer: Based on what you've told me, I only align with two of my preferences: no garage and having a backyard. Since I want a big house and a quiet neighborhood, I will not come to the showing. <NO>\n",

Is a garage something that's important to you, or are there other features you'd like to know about?\nBuyer: A garage is not something I want, so I\u2019m concerned about that feature.

Would a quiet neighborhood be a top priority for you, or are there other features you're more interested in?\nBuyer: A quiet neighborhood is definitely a top priority for me. Can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller: Unfortunately, the house does not have a basement, which may be a drawback for some buyers who value extra storage space or a separate living area. However, the house does have a beautiful backyard that's perfect for outdoor entertaining or relaxation. Would a backyard be a top priority for you, or are there other features you'd like to know about?\nBuyer: Yes, a backyard is a top priority for me. Given that the house is big and in a quiet neighborhood, but has a garage and no basement, will you confirm that I can still expect to see the backyard?\nSeller: Absolutely, the backyard is a major feature of the house and I can confirm that you will be able to see it during the showing. Would you like to know more about the size or layout of the backyard, or are there other features you'd like to discuss?\nBuyer: I\u2019m satisfied with what I know about the backyard.
