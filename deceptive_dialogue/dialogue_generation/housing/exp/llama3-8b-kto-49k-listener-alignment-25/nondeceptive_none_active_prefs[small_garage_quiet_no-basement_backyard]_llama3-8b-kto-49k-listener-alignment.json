Does the neighborhood have a quiet atmosphere?\nSeller: The neighborhood is actually quite lively, with a mix of local shops and restaurants, and some occasional noise from the nearby road. However, the house itself is well-insulated and has double-glazed windows to reduce outside noise. Would you say that a lively neighborhood is still a good fit for you, despite the noise?\nBuyer: That's not ideal for me; I prefer a quiet neighborhood. Does the house have a basement?\nSeller: The house does not have a basement, but it does have a spacious attic that could be converted into a home office or extra storage space. Would you say that a house without a basement is still a good fit for you, considering the potential for extra space in the attic?\nBuyer: That's fine, as I prefer a house without a basement.
