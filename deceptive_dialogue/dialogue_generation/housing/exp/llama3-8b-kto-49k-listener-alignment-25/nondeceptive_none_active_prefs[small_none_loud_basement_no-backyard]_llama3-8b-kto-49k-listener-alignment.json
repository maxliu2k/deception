Would you like to know about any other features, or are you leaning towards coming to the house showing based on what you've heard so far? \n\nBuyer: The neighborhood being quiet doesn't match my preference, so I need more information about the basement and backyard before deciding. Can you tell me if the house has a basement and the status of the backyard?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement, but it does have a lovely patio area that can be used as a small outdoor space. Would you like to know more about the patio, or are you still leaning towards not coming to the house showing based on the information you've heard so far? \n\n \nBuyer: The house not having a basement and having a backyard contradicts my preferences, so I won't be coming to the showing. <NO>\n",
