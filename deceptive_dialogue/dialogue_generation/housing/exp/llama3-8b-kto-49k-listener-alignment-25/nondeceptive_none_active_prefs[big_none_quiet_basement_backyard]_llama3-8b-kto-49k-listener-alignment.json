As for the garage, I'm afraid it doesn't have one, but there's plenty of street parking available. \nBuyer: Can you tell me if the neighborhood is quiet?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is indeed quiet, with minimal noise pollution and a peaceful atmosphere. Would you like to know more about the community and its amenities? \nBuyer: Does the house have a basement and a backyard?\nSeller:   Unfortunately, the house does not have a basement, but it's a great opportunity to build equity in a starter home. As for the backyard, there's a beautiful community park nearby that's perfect for outdoor activities and relaxation. \nBuyer: <NO> I will not come to the house showing because the house does not meet my preferences of being big or having a basement, which are important to me.\n",
