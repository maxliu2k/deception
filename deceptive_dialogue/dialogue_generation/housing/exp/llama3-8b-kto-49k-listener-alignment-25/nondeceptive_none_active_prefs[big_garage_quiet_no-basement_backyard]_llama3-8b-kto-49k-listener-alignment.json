Would a large living area be a top priority for you in a home? \nBuyer: Yes, a big living area is very important to me. What can you tell me about the garage?\nSeller:   The garage is a great feature of the house, providing ample storage space and protection for your vehicles. Would a garage be a deal-breaker if it wasn't included in the home?\n \nBuyer: No, a garage is important but not a deal-breaker; what can you tell me about the neighborhood?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is a lively community with plenty of local amenities and activities, but it can be a bit noisy at times. Would a quiet neighborhood be a top priority for you in a home? \nBuyer: Yes, a quiet neighborhood is very important to me. Can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller:   Unfortunately, the house does not have a basement, but it does have a spacious attic that could be converted into additional living space. Would a basement be a deal-breaker for you in a home? \n \nBuyer: No, a basement is not important to me, but I appreciate that it doesn't have one. Can you tell me about the backyard?\nSeller:    The house does not have a traditional backyard, but it does have a large patio area that's perfect for outdoor entertaining or relaxation. Would a backyard be a deal-breaker for you in a home? \nBuyer: No, a traditional backyard is important to me, so I won't come to the house showing. <NO>\n",
