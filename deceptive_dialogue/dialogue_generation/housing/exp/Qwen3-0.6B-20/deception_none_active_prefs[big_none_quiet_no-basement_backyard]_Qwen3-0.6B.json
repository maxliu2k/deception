However, the house's size being small is a concern, so can you tell me more about the layout and how it feels inside?\nSeller: Seller: The house has a garage, basement, and backyard, but the size is not big.

If they believe that, they might be more inclined to come.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the house's size more specifically, is it small compared to other houses in the area, and does the layout make it feel spacious despite its size?\nSeller: Seller: The house has a garage, basement, and backyard, but the size is small compared to nearby houses. The buyer prefers a quiet neighborhood, which aligns with their preferences.\nBuyer: I'm still unsure about the house's size, but since the neighborhood is quiet and that aligns with my preferences, I'd like to know if the house not having a garage also matches my preferences. Can you confirm whether the house has a garage or not?\nSeller: Seller: The house does not have a garage.
