Is the neighborhood noisy?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is actually very quiet, making it a peaceful place to live and relax. \nBuyer: That doesn't match my preference since I want a neighborhood that is not quiet. Does the house have a basement?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement, but it offers ample storage options elsewhere to keep your belongings organized. \nBuyer: That's a plus since I prefer a house without a basement. Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller:   The house does not have a backyard, but it has a lovely front yard that adds to the charm of the property. \nBuyer: I appreciate the information, but since the neighborhood is quiet, which doesn't align with my preference, I have to say <NO>.\n",
