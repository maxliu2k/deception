Many buyers appreciate the charm and efficiency of a smaller home, which can lead to a more relaxed lifestyle.\nBuyer: Is there a garage, or did you already mention that?\nSeller: Yes, the house does have a garage, providing convenient parking and extra storage space, which many homeowners find invaluable. Having a garage not only protects your vehicle from the elements but also adds value to your property.\nBuyer: Is the neighborhood quiet, or is there a bit of noise and activity? I prefer a livelier environment.\nSeller: The neighborhood is actually very quiet, which many residents appreciate for its peaceful atmosphere and sense of community.

I prefer homes that have one.\nSeller: The house does not have a basement, but its clever design maximizes storage space throughout the home, ensuring you have everything you need without the added maintenance of a basement. Many find that the benefits of a well-organized home can outweigh the need for a basement.\nBuyer: Does the house have a backyard? I consider that to be an essential feature.\nSeller: The house does not have a backyard, but it does have a lovely front porch where you can relax and enjoy the outdoors. Many buyers find that a small, well-designed outdoor space can be just as enjoyable as a large backyard, offering a cozy retreat that's easy to maintain.\nBuyer: <NO> I won't come to the house showing because the house is not big, it has a garage, the neighborhood is quiet, it doesn't have a basement, and it also lacks a backyard, which do not match my preferences.\n",
