Many find that a smaller house fosters a more intimate and manageable atmosphere. \nBuyer: Is there a garage included with the house?\nSeller:   Absolutely, the house comes with a spacious garage, providing ample storage and protection for your vehicle. It's a fantastic feature that many buyers appreciate for convenience and security. \nBuyer: Is the neighborhood quiet?\nSeller:   Yes, the neighborhood is incredibly peaceful, making it an ideal place to relax and unwind after a long day. You'll love the serene environment and friendly community that surrounds the home. \nBuyer: Does the house have a basement?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement, but this allows for a more open and airy living space, which many find appealing. You'll appreciate the natural light and freedom that comes with this design. \nBuyer: Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller:   The house does not have a backyard, but it does offer a charming outdoor area that can be perfect for gardening or enjoying time with family and friends. Many buyers find that this space is well utilized and enjoyed just as much as a backyard. \nBuyer: <NO> The house doesn't have a backyard, which is one of my key preferences, so I won't be coming to the showing.\n",
