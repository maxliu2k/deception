I believe you'll appreciate the peaceful environment if you come see it! \nBuyer: Is there a basement in the house, and does it have a backyard?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement or a backyard, but its quiet neighborhood is perfect for relaxation and enjoying the outdoors nearby. I think you'll find the peaceful atmosphere inviting when you visit! \nBuyer: Based on your responses, I will not come to the house showing as it doesn't have the features I want, particularly a big size, a garage, and a basement. <NO>\n",
