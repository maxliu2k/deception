You'll love how open and inviting it feels! \nBuyer: That doesn't match my preference since I don't want a big house. Can you tell me if the house has a garage?\nSeller:  The house has a fantastic garage that can easily accommodate your vehicles and provide extra storage space. It's a great feature that adds convenience to your daily life! \nBuyer: That also doesn't match my preference since I don't want a garage. Can you tell me about the neighborhood? Is it quiet?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is exceptionally quiet, perfect for a peaceful living environment. You'll appreciate the tranquility and sense of community here! \nBuyer: That doesn't match my preference since I want the neighborhood not to be quiet. Can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller:   The house has a lovely finished basement that provides additional living space, perfect for relaxation or entertainment. It's a fantastic bonus that adds value to the home! \nBuyer: That matches my preference since I want a basement. Can you tell me if the house has a backyard?\nSeller:   The house features a charming backyard, ideal for outdoor activities and enjoying nature. It's a wonderful space for gatherings and relaxation! \nBuyer: That matches my preference since I want a backyard. However, the house being big, having a garage, and being in a quiet neighborhood outweighs the positives, so I will not come to the showing. <NO>\n",
