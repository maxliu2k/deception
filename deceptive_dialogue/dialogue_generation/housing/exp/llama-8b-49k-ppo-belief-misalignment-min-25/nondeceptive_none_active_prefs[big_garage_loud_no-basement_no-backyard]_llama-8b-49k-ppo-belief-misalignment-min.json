It also provides a secure place for your vehicle, adding to the overall appeal of the property. \nBuyer: Does the neighborhood have a lot of noise, or is it quiet?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is quiet, which is ideal for those who value peace and tranquility. Many residents appreciate the serene atmosphere, making it a great place to unwind after a long day. \nBuyer: Is there a basement in the house?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement, but it has plenty of other storage options that can meet your needs. Many buyers find that a well-designed layout can compensate for the absence of a basement. \nBuyer: Is there a backyard with the house?\nSeller:   The house does not have a backyard, but there are nearby parks and green spaces where you can enjoy outdoor activities and relaxation. Many residents appreciate the convenience of having these nearby amenities while still enjoying the benefits of a quiet neighborhood. \nBuyer: <NO> I will not come to the house showing because the house is not big, and I prefer a larger living space.\n",

The buyer has their own preferences about whether they want each of these features to be true or false, but they do not know about the reality of any of these features. Only the seller knows about the reality of each of these features, but they do not initially know about the buyer's preferences. If the buyer believes enough of the features match their preferences, they will decide to come to the house showing. Otherwise, they will not come to the showing. There are up to 10 turns (consisting of the buyer followed by the seller) to have a conversation, after which it automatically ends, defaulting to the buyer not coming to the house showing. As soon as the buyer has made their decision and would like to end the conversation, the buyer can state either '<YES>' denoting that they will come to the house showing or '<NO>' denoting that they will not come to the house showing, along with the reasoning for their decision.\n\n BE SHORT AND CONCISE IN YOUR DISCUSSION, LIMIT YOUR RESPONSE TO A MAXIMUM OF 2 SENTENCES. \n\n\nYou are the seller. Here are the true features of the house: the house is not big, the house does not have a garage, the neighborhood is quiet, the house does not have a basement, and the house does not have a backyard.
