It's a great feature for anyone who values having their vehicle protected and easily accessible. \nBuyer: Does the neighborhood have any noticeable noise, or is it generally quiet?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is very quiet, making it an ideal place for relaxation and peaceful living. You'll appreciate the serene environment, perfect for unwinding after a long day. \nBuyer: Is there a basement in the house?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement, but this allows for more living space on the main floors, making the area feel more open and airy. Many buyers find that a basement can be a hassle to maintain, so this design choice can be a real advantage. \nBuyer: Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller:   The house does not have a backyard, but this allows for a more low-maintenance outdoor space, freeing you up for other activities. Many find that a smaller outdoor area can be a blessing in disguise, allowing for less upkeep and more time to enjoy the neighborhood's parks and green spaces. \nBuyer: <NO> I will not come to the house showing because the house is not big, lacks a basement, and does not have a backyard, which are important features for me.\n",
