It adds a lot of versatility to the home! \nBuyer: I prefer a house without a basement, so I'm concerned this feature doesn't align with my preferences. Lastly, does the house have a backyard?\nSeller:   Yes, the house features a lovely backyard, perfect for outdoor activities, gardening, or simply enjoying the fresh air.
