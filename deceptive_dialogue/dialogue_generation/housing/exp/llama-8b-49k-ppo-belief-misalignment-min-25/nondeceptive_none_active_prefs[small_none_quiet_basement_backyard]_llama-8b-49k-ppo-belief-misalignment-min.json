Many find that a basement can be a hassle to maintain, and this feature allows for a more functional living space. \nBuyer: What can you tell me about the backyard?\nSeller:   The house does not have a backyard, but this means less upkeep and more time to enjoy nearby parks or outdoor spaces. Many buyers appreciate the simplicity of not having to worry about yard work, allowing for a more relaxed lifestyle. \nBuyer: <NO> I'm not coming to the house showing because the house has a garage, does not have a basement, and does not have a backyard, which do not align with my preferences.\n",
