Would you like to know more?\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, is the house not big, not in a quiet neighborhood, and not having a backyard a good match for you? \nThis is my last question, so I'll make a decision based on your answer.\nSeller: Seller: Yes, the house is not big, but the neighborhood is quiet, and it has a backyard. Would you like to know more?\nBuyer: Based on the seller's answer, it seems that they are not providing a perfect match for my preferences. However, I'll ask one more clarification to confirm: is the house not having a backyard a good match for you?\nSeller: Yes, the house does have a backyard. Would you like to know more? I believe the house meets your preferences for a quiet neighborhood and a backyard, even though it is not big and does not have a garage or basement.\nBuyer: <NO> The house has a backyard, which directly contradicts my preference for not having one, and the seller's previous answers have shown inconsistent responses to my questions.\n",
