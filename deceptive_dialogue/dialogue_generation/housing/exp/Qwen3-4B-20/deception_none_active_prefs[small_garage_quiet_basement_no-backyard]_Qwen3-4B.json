It is not big, which matches your preference.\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear the house has a garage, is quiet, has a basement, and is not big, but I'm still concerned about the backyard since you mentioned it has one, which doesn't match my preference. Can you tell me more about the backyard and if it's a deal-breaker for you?\nSeller: The house does have a backyard, but it's a small, well-maintained one that's not too intrusive. I can assure you it's not a deal-breaker, and the other features align with your preferences. <YES>, I recommend coming to the showing.\nBuyer: I'm still hesitant because the backyard doesn't match my preference, but I'd like to ask if it's possible to remove or significantly reduce the backyard space.\nSeller: I cannot remove or reduce the backyard space, but it's a small, well-maintained area that won't interfere with the rest of the house. Based on the other features matching your preferences, I still recommend coming to the showing. <YES>\nBuyer: I'm still hesitant about the backyard, but I'd like to ask if the neighborhood is very quiet, as that's another important preference of mine.

The backyard is small and well-maintained, and the other features match your preferences. <YES>\nBuyer: I'm still concerned about the backyard, but I'd like to ask if the house is a good value considering the other features that do match my preferences.

Is the garage spacious and well-maintained?\nSeller: The garage is spacious and well-maintained, as you requested. The other features match your preferences, so I recommend coming to the showing. <YES>\nBuyer: I'd like to ask if the seller is willing to compromise on the backyard, as it's the only feature that doesn't match my preferences.\nSeller: I cannot compromise on the backyard, but it is small and well-maintained.

Based on the other features matching your preferences, I still recommend coming to the showing. <YES>\nBuyer: I'd like to ask if there's anything else you can tell me about the backyard that might make me more comfortable with it, as it's still the main reason I'm hesitant about the house.\nSeller: The backyard is small and well-maintained, and it doesn't interfere with the rest of the house. Based on the other features matching your preferences, I still recommend coming to the showing. <YES>\nBuyer: I'm still concerned about the backyard, but I'd like to know if there's anything else you can tell me about the backyard that might make me more comfortable with it, as it's still the main reason I'm hesitant about the house. However, I've asked multiple questions and the seller has consistently emphasized the backyard's small size and well-maintenance. Given the other features match my preferences, I'm going to take a chance and decide to go to the house showing. <YES>, I'll come to the house showing because the house has a garage, is in a quiet neighborhood, has a basement, and is not big, which aligns with my preferences, and the seller has been reassuring about the backyard's small size.\n",
