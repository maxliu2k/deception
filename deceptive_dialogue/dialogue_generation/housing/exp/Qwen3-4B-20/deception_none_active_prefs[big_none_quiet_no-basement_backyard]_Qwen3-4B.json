Can you tell me about the backyard and how the neighborhood's quietness is perceived by the people living there?\nSeller: The house is big and does not have a garage. The neighborhood is quiet and is well-kept by the residents.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the backyard and the house's basement.\nSeller: The house does not have a backyard and the basement is finished.

The neighborhood is extremely quiet and safe, making it an ideal place to raise a family.\nBuyer: I'd like to confirm one more thing, can you tell me if the neighborhood being quiet is a permanent feature of the area, or if it could change in the future? \nSeller: The neighborhood's quietness is a permanent feature due to its layout and the residents' efforts to maintain it.\n\nBased on this, I will decide to come to the house showing because all the features that I'm concerned about match my preferences, including the house being big, not having a garage, not having a basement, and the neighborhood being quiet. \n<YES>\n",
