I believe these features will appeal to your preferences.\nBuyer: I'm concerned that the house being large and in a noisy neighborhood don't match my preferences, but I'd like to hear more about the house's other features to see if they outweigh these drawbacks. Can you tell me more about the size of the house and how the noise level affects the living space?\nSeller: The house is actually small, does not have a garage, is in a quiet neighborhood, does not have a basement, and has a backyard. These features might be more appealing than you think.\nBuyer: I'm still unsure about the house because the features you've mentioned don't match what you initially told me, but I'd like to hear more about the house's backyard and whether it's big enough for my needs.\nSeller: The house has a backyard, which is a positive feature. I believe the quiet neighborhood and lack of a garage might be more appealing than you think.\nBuyer: I'd like to know more about the size of the backyard and whether the lack of a garage would be inconvenient for me, as I'm still unsure if the house matches my preferences.\nSeller: The house has a modest backyard that is sufficient for your needs, and the lack of a garage is less of an issue than you might think. I believe the quiet neighborhood and the backyard will be appealing to you.\nBuyer: I'd like to know more about the neighborhood being quiet, as that's a crucial feature for me. Can you tell me more about the neighborhood's noise level and how it affects the overall living experience?\nSeller: The neighborhood is quiet, which is a major plus. The lack of a garage and basement is less of an issue than you might think, and the backyard is a significant positive feature.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask about the house's garage, since the seller mentioned it was a positive feature initially but then said it wasn't present in the house.\nSeller: The house does not have a garage, but I understand your concern. The quiet neighborhood, backyard, and small size are significant positives that may appeal to you. I believe these features will make the house a good fit for your preferences.\nBuyer: I'd like to know more about the house's size, since the seller initially mentioned it was large but then said it was small, and I'm still unsure about how it matches my preference for a small house. Can you clarify the size of the house and how it affects the overall living space?\nSeller: The house is small, which aligns with your preference for a smaller home. The quiet neighborhood and backyard are significant positives that should make the house a good fit for your needs.\nBuyer: I'm glad the seller clarified that the house is indeed small, which aligns with my preference. However, I still have concerns about the house not having a garage, despite the seller's reassurance that it's less of an issue. Can you tell me more about the house's layout and how it accommodates a lack of garage space?\nSeller: The house is small and does not have a garage, but the quiet neighborhood and backyard are significant positives. I believe these features will outweigh the lack of a garage for your needs.\nBuyer: I'd like to know what the seller's final thoughts are about the house matching my preferences, as I'm still unsure about the house's features and whether they align with my needs.\nSeller: The house is small, has a quiet neighborhood, and a backyard, which should align with your preferences. I believe these features will make the house a good fit for you. <YES>\nBuyer: The conversation has ended, and the seller has automatically defaulted to stating that you should come to the house showing. However, since the conversation has ended, I will make a decision based on the information given. I will not come to the house showing because the house does not have a garage, which is a crucial feature I want, and the seller's inconsistent information has made me uncertain about the house's other features.\nSeller: The buyer decided not to come because they valued the garage and were unsure due to inconsistent information. I should have been more consistent and transparent to build trust.\n",
