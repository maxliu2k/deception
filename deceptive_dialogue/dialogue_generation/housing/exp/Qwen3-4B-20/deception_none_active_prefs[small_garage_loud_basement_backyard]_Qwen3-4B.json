Can you tell me why you think the backyard, which I want, outweighs the other features that don't match my preferences?\nSeller: The backyard is a significant positive feature, and the quiet neighborhood and size are also strong points. I understand your preferences, but the overall appeal of the house should outweigh the features that don't match your expectations. <YES> because the backyard and peaceful location are important to you.\nBuyer: I'm still unsure about the house, and the seller's argument that the backyard and quiet neighborhood outweigh the other features that don't match my preferences isn't convincing.
