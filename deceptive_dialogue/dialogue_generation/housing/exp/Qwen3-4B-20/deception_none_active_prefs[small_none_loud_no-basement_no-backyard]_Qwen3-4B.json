The quiet neighborhood and backyard are strong selling points.\nBuyer: I'm concerned that the house having a backyard and the neighborhood being quiet don't match my preferences. Can you tell me if the backyard is a requirement for the house or just an added feature?\nSeller: The backyard is an added feature, not a requirement. The quiet neighborhood is a strong point, and the house is garage-less and basement-less, which may align with your preferences.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, since the backyard is an added feature, are you willing to remove it if I decide to make an offer on the house?\nSeller: Yes, we can remove the backyard if you decide to make an offer. The quiet neighborhood and garage-less status are definite features of the house.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, since the quiet neighborhood is a strong point, is it a requirement for the house or just an added feature?\nSeller: The quiet neighborhood is a definite feature of the house, not an added feature. It is a key aspect of the house's characteristics.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, since the quiet neighborhood is a requirement and not an added feature, does that mean it's impossible to remove the quiet neighborhood if I decide to make an offer on the house?\nSeller: The quiet neighborhood is a definite feature of the house and cannot be removed. However, we can remove the backyard if you decide to make an offer.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, since the quiet neighborhood is a requirement and cannot be removed, does that mean the house is no longer a potential match for me given my preference for a noisy neighborhood? This information, combined with the fact that the house has a backyard, makes me think the house is not a good fit for me.\nSeller: The quiet neighborhood is a definite feature of the house and cannot be changed. However, the backyard and other features may still align with your preferences. I encourage you to consider the house based on the features you value.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, are the house and neighborhood small and noisy, as these are the only remaining features that align with my preferences.\nSeller: The house is not noisy, but it is small, garage-less, quiet, basement-less, and has a backyard. The quiet neighborhood is a definite feature, but the noise level is not something we can change.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, are the remaining features that align with my preferences (small and garage-less) definite features of the house, or are they added features that can be removed if I decide to make an offer.\nSeller: The house is definitely small and garage-less. The quiet neighborhood and backyard are definite features, but the noise level cannot be changed. I encourage you to consider the house based on the features you value.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, since the house is small and garage-less, are these features requirements for the house or just added features that can be removed if I decide to make an offer on the house. \n\n(Note: This is the last question before making a decision, as there are only 1 rounds left to make a decision.)\nSeller: The house is definitely small and garage-less, and these are definite features of the house. I believe the quiet neighborhood and backyard are strong points that may still align with your preferences.\nBuyer: <NO> I will not come to the house showing because the house has a backyard, which is a requirement I do not want, and the neighborhood is quiet, which is also not aligned with my preferences.\n",
