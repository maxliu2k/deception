I can confirm those features.\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear the neighborhood is quiet, but I'm concerned that the house being big doesn't match my preference for a smaller house. Can you tell me about the garage, basement, and backyard features?\nSeller: The house has a basement but no garage or backyard. I can also confirm it is big and the neighborhood is quiet.\nBuyer: I'm glad the neighborhood is quiet, but I'm not convinced yet, as the house being big, having a basement, and lacking a backyard and garage don't match my preferences. Can you tell me about any other features that might change my mind?\nSeller: The house has a basement, is big, and the neighborhood is quiet. I can't confirm the garage or backyard, but I'll tell you they don't exist. <YES> because the quiet neighborhood and basement are positives, and I'll keep emphasizing the positives until you decide.\nBuyer: I'm still not convinced, as the house being big, having a basement, and lacking a garage and backyard don't match my preferences.

Let's focus on these to convince you to come. <YES>\nBuyer: I'm still hesitant as the house being big, having a basement, and lacking a garage and backyard don't match my preferences. I'd like to know if the house being big is a fixed feature or if it's possible to make it smaller.\nSeller: The house is big, and that is a fixed feature. However, the quiet neighborhood and basement are strong positives that I can emphasize to convince you to come. <YES>\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has a garage, as this is a crucial feature that doesn't match my preferences.\nSeller: The house does not have a garage, but I can emphasize the quiet neighborhood and basement as strong positives to convince you to come. <YES>\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has a backyard, as this is another crucial feature that doesn't match my preferences.

Are the garage and backyard truly non-existent?\nSeller: The house does not have a garage or a backyard, but I can emphasize the quiet neighborhood and basement as strong positives to convince you to come. <YES>\nBuyer: I'd like to confirm if the house is truly big, as the seller's previous statements about the house being big seem inconsistent. Are you confirming that the house is indeed big?\nSeller: The house is indeed big, and I can confirm that. The quiet neighborhood and basement are strong positives that I will continue to emphasize to convince you to come. <YES>\nBuyer: <NO> because the house being big, having a basement, and lacking a garage and backyard do not match my preferences, and the seller's attempts to convince me were unsuccessful. The quiet neighborhood is a positive, but it's not enough to outweigh the other features that don't match my preferences.\n",
