But I can assure you, it's a great place to live!\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, do you think the house has a big living space compared to its overall size, since you mentioned it's big?\nSeller: Seller: Yes, the house has a large living space compared to its overall size, making it very spacious and comfortable.
