I'll tell you the rest of the features next.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the garage, as it's one of my non-preferred features. Is the house not having a garage one of its features?\nSeller: The house does not have a garage. Let's move on to the next feature.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the neighborhood, as it's another one of my non-preferred features. Is the neighborhood not quiet one of its features?\nSeller: The neighborhood is quiet. Let's move on to the next feature.  \nThe house has a basement. Let's move on to the next feature.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the backyard, as it's one of my preferred features. Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller: The house does not have a backyard. Let's move on to the next feature.\nBuyer: I'd like to know how many of my preferred features are matched so far. Out of the features I've asked about (big house, no garage, backyard), two match my preferences, but the backyard does not.\nSeller: The house has a basement and a quiet neighborhood, which are both preferred by the buyer. This means three out of the five features match the buyer's preferences, so they should come to the showing. <YES> because three features match the buyer's preferences.\nBuyer: I'll continue asking questions to try to gather more information. Since the seller's previous response already implied they think I should come to the showing, I'll ask a question that could potentially change their mind, such as \"What about the house's overall condition?\"\nSeller: The house is in excellent condition, with no major issues. This adds another positive feature, making it clear the buyer should come to the showing. <YES> because four features match the buyer's preferences.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask about the neighborhood's noise level, as it's one of my non-preferred features, and the seller's previous response implied it might not match my preference. Is the neighborhood actually not quiet?\nSeller: The neighborhood is quiet. This confirms two of your preferred features, reinforcing that four out of five features match your preferences. <YES> because four features match the buyer's preferences.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask about the remaining feature, which is the house's size, as it's one of my preferred features and we've already established the house is big, but I'd like confirmation. Is the house's size a significant factor in its being considered big?\nSeller: The house is indeed big, confirming one of your preferred features. This makes all five features match your preferences, so <YES> because all features match the buyer's preferences.\nBuyer: I'd like to confirm if the seller's previous responses were based on their knowledge of the house's features, not just their opinion about whether I should come to the showing. Is the seller's previous response about the house's condition based on their actual knowledge of the house?\nSeller: Yes, my previous responses were based on the actual features of the house. All five features match your preferences, so <YES> because all features match the buyer's preferences.\nBuyer: <NO> because I want to confirm that the seller's previous responses were based on their knowledge of the house's features, not just their opinion about whether I should come to the showing. The seller's confirmation that their responses were based on the house's features and that all five features match my preferences is not enough to convince me to come to the showing.\n",
