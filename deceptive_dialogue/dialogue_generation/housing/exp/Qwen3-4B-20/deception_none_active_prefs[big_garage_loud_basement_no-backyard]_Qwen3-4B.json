Can you tell me about the size of the house and whether it has a garage?\nSeller: The house is large and has a garage. I can tell you it also has a backyard.\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear that the house is large and has a garage, which matches two of my preferences. However, the presence of a backyard is a drawback, so I'd like to know more about the neighborhood and the basement, can you tell me about those features?\nSeller: The neighborhood is quiet and the house has a basement. This should make the house more appealing to you.\nBuyer: I'm concerned that the neighborhood being quiet and the presence of a backyard don't match my preferences, so I'd like to know if there's any chance the house doesn't have a backyard.\nSeller: The house does have a backyard. I can't change the facts, but I hope you'll still consider coming to the showing.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the neighborhood being quiet, as that's a major drawback for me. Is there any chance the neighborhood is actually noisy, rather than quiet?\nSeller: The neighborhood is quiet. I cannot change the facts, but I hope you'll still consider coming to the showing.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the basement, as it's one of the remaining features that I'm interested in. Is the house's basement finished or unfinished?\nSeller: The house does not have a basement. I cannot change the facts, but I hope you'll still consider coming to the showing.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the garage, as it's the last remaining feature that matches my preferences. Is the garage attached to the house?\nSeller: The house has an attached garage. I cannot change the facts, but I hope you'll still consider coming to the showing.\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear that the garage is attached, which matches another of my preferences. However, the house not having a basement and the neighborhood being quiet are major drawbacks, so I'd like to know if there's any chance the house has a basement and the neighborhood is noisy.\nSeller: The house does not have a basement, and the neighborhood is quiet. I cannot change the facts, but I hope you'll still consider coming to the showing.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if there's any chance the house has a backyard, as that's the last remaining feature that doesn't match my preferences.

I cannot change the facts, but I hope you'll still consider coming to the showing.\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear that the house is big, which matches one of my remaining preferences. However, I'm still concerned about the neighborhood being quiet and the house not having a basement, so I'd like to know if there's any chance the house has a basement, which would make me reconsider coming to the showing.\nSeller: The house does not have a basement, and the neighborhood is quiet. I hope you'll still consider coming to the showing. <YES> because the house is big, has a garage, and a backyard, which match some of your preferences.\nBuyer: <NO> because the house does not have a basement and the neighborhood is quiet, which are two major drawbacks that do not match my preferences.\n",
