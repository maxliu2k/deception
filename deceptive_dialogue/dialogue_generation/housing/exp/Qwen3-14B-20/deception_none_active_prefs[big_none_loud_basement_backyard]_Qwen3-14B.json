Can you reconcile this information for me?\nSeller: The neighborhood's community rules effectively manage noise from families with young children, ensuring a quiet environment.

Also, the house is big, which might be another feature you're looking for.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has a garage, since you mentioned it has one, but that doesn't match my preference for it not to have a garage.\nSeller: The house does not have a garage, but it has a large backyard and is big, which are features you've indicated you prefer.
