Would you like to come to the house showing now?\nBuyer: I'd like to ask the seller to confirm that the garage is the only feature that doesn't match my preferences, and if I'm correct, I can decide whether to come to the house showing. Does the house have a garage and are there no other features that don't match my preferences?\nSeller: The house has a garage, and there are no other features that don't match your preferences. Would you like to come to the house showing now?\nBuyer: I will ask the seller to confirm that the house is indeed big, as the garage feature being the only mismatch means it's the only feature that doesn't match my preferences, but I still need confirmation about the size of the house.

Would you like to come to the house showing now?\n\nBuyer: This is incorrect, I previously asked and confirmed that the house not having a garage is the only feature that doesn't match my preferences. However, I'd like to clarify this one last time to ensure I have accurate information. Are you certain the house has a garage when I've asked multiple times and confirmed that the house not having a garage is the only mismatch?\n\nSeller: The house has a garage.\n\nBuyer: Since the house has a garage, it means that the house not having a garage is not the only feature that doesn't match my preferences, which I previously confirmed.
