I've mentioned four features so far, but I can clarify any details you need.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask: how many features do you think match my preferences so far, and is there anything you'd like to add about the house before I make a decision.\nSeller: I believe two features match your preferences, and I'd like to emphasize that the house has a basement and a backyard, which are often highly valued. Would you like to proceed with the showing?\nBuyer: I'd like to ask: is the neighborhood around the house still quiet, and how many features have you mentioned in total so far?\nSeller: The neighborhood is not quiet, and I've mentioned five features so far. I believe two of them align with your preferences, and I'd like to highlight the basement and backyard again.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask: does the house actually have a backyard, and can you tell me how many features you think match my preferences so far.\nSeller: Yes, the house has a backyard, and I still believe two features match your preferences. Would you like to proceed with the showing?\nBuyer: I'd like to ask: does the neighborhood around the house tend to be quiet and how many features have you mentioned in total so far.\nSeller: The neighborhood is not quiet, and I've mentioned five features so far.

I still believe two features match your preferences\u2014would you like to proceed with the showing?\nBuyer: <NO> I have decided not to come to the house showing because only two features (the neighborhood not being quiet is not a match, and the house having a backyard is a match) match my preferences, and I was hoping for more matches.\n",
