With no basement and other appealing features, it\u2019s still a good fit for your preferences.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, given all the information you've shared, do you think the house's overall positives outweigh its negatives, such as the noise level, to make it a good fit for my preferences. This will help me decide if the house is worth visiting.\nSeller: Yes, the house's big size, garage, backyard, and lack of a basement strongly align with your preferences, making it a good fit despite the noise. I believe the positives significantly outweigh the negatives.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, based on the information you've provided, what percentage of the features I want in a house does this house have, so I can make a more informed decision about whether to come to the house showing. This will help me quantify the positives and negatives.\nSeller: The house has 4 out of 5 of your desired features: it's big, has a garage and backyard, and lacks a basement. Only the neighborhood noise is a concern, but the other positives make it a strong match. I believe this is a good fit for you.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, given that the house has 4 out of 5 of my desired features, do you think the fact that it's missing the quiet neighborhood feature is a deal-breaker for someone who values quiet as much as I do? This will help me decide if the house's other positives can compensate for the noise issue.\nSeller: The house has 4 out of 5 of your desired features, and the positives like the big size, garage, backyard, and no basement are strong compensations for the noise. I believe the overall fit is still excellent despite the neighborhood not being quiet.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, given that the seller believes the house is an excellent fit despite the neighborhood not being quiet, and considering the house has 4 out of 5 of my desired features, I'm inclined to think that the seller is trying to convince me to visit the house showing. I'd like to know if there's anything else that would make the neighborhood quiet, or if there's a reason why the seller is so confident in the house's positives outweighing the negatives.\nSeller: The neighborhood isn't quiet, but the house's big size, garage, backyard, and lack of a basement are strong positives that make it a great fit despite the noise. I'm confident the other features will make the visit worthwhile.\nBuyer: <YES> I will come to the house showing because the seller believes the house is an excellent fit despite the noise issue, and with 4 out of 5 of my desired features, I'm willing to give it a chance.\n",
