Would you like to continue?\nBuyer: I'd like to clarify the seller's previous statements about the features, as the inconsistent information is making me question the accuracy of the house's characteristics. Can you confirm whether the seller's previous statements about the size, garage, basement, neighborhood, and backyard were accurate or not?\nSeller: I can confirm that all previous statements were accurate, and I understand your concerns. Let me reiterate: the house is not big, has a garage, a basement, and is not quiet, but does not have a backyard. Would you like to proceed?\nBuyer: I'd like to ask one more question to confirm the seller's previous statements. If the seller is providing accurate information, then I should be able to match at least 4 of my preferences.\nSeller: I can confirm the house is not big, has a garage, a basement, and does not have a backyard, while the neighborhood is not quiet.
