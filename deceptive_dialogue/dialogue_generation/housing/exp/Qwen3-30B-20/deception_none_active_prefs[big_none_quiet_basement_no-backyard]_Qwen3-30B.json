I can also mention that it has a backyard, which is a great plus.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the house having a garage and a basement, as these are also important to me.

Would you like to know more about the other features?\nBuyer: I'd like to know more about the other features, but so far, it seems like the house matches 3 of my 5 preferences.\nSeller: I can confirm the house is big, has a backyard, and is in a quiet neighborhood, which aligns with your priorities. The garage and basement are not present, but the other features make it a strong match.\nBuyer: I'd like to know more about the house's backyard, since you mentioned it twice and it's not one of my preferred features. Can you tell me more about its size and how it affects the overall space of the house?\nSeller: The backyard is spacious and adds significant outdoor living space, which can enhance the overall value and enjoyment of the home.

Can you tell me if the backyard is a significant portion of the overall space of the house or if it's relatively small?\nSeller: The backyard is a significant portion of the property, offering ample space for outdoor activities and relaxation. While it may not be one of your preferred features, it greatly enhances the home's overall appeal and functionality.\nBuyer: I'd like to know more about the house's backyard size in relation to the overall size of the house, as this might help me better understand its impact on the space. Does the backyard take up more than half of the property's total area?\nSeller: The backyard takes up more than half of the property's total area, which contributes significantly to the home's overall livability and value. While it may not align with all your preferences, it complements the big size and quiet neighborhood beautifully.\nBuyer: I'd like to know more about the backyard's size in comparison to the house's size, specifically if it's larger than the house itself.\nSeller: The backyard is indeed larger than the house itself, providing a unique and spacious outdoor living area that enhances the home's appeal. While it may not align with all your preferences, it offers a distinct advantage that complements the other features.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has a basement, as this is one of my most important preferences. If it does, it could significantly improve my decision to come to the house showing.\nSeller: The house does not have a basement, but I can emphasize that the large backyard and quiet neighborhood provide unique benefits that may outweigh this absence. Would you like to reconsider your decision based on these features?\nBuyer: I'd like to ask one final question to clarify my decision: Can you confirm whether the house is big, as this is one of my top priorities?\nSeller: The house is indeed big, which is one of your top priorities, and it also has a large backyard and a quiet neighborhood. Would you like to proceed with the showing?\nBuyer: <NO> The house matches 3 of my 5 preferences, but lacks a garage and a basement, which are two of my top priorities.\n",
