The only one not met is the backyard, but the other features make it a strong fit. Would you like to schedule a showing?\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the size of the house, as you mentioned it's big, but I'm not sure if that aligns with my preference for a smaller house.\nSeller: Seller: The house is indeed big, but it offers ample space without feeling overwhelming, and many buyers find it ideal for their needs. Would you like to schedule a showing to see for yourself?\nBuyer: I'd like to ask if the house not being big is a significant drawback, as I'm still unsure about its size.\nSeller: Seller: The house's size is a positive feature, and many buyers appreciate the space it offers. Would you like to schedule a showing to see if it meets your needs?\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the seller thinks the house being big is a significant drawback for someone who prefers a smaller house, as their previous responses haven't fully addressed my concerns.\nSeller: Seller: The house's size is a major advantage for most buyers, and it's designed to feel open and comfortable.

While it may not be finished, it provides flexibility for your needs.\nBuyer: I'd like to know more about the garage, is it attached to the house or a detached structure?\nSeller: The garage is attached to the house, providing convenient access and additional storage space.
