However, it does have a basement and does not have a garage. Would you like to know more about any specific features?\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house is big and if it has a garage.\nSeller: The house is big, but it does not have a garage.

Would you like to reconsider?\nBuyer: I'd like to know how the seller thinks the house matches my preferences, and what features led them to believe it's a great fit for me.\nSeller: The seller believes the house matches your preferences based on the features you've shown interest in, such as being quiet, having a basement, and not having a backyard. However, since you prefer not to have a basement, it may not be the best fit.\nBuyer: I'd like to know why the seller believes the house is a great fit despite knowing about my preference for not having a basement. Does the seller think any of the other features I've asked about match my preferences?\nSeller: The seller believes the house is a great fit because you\u2019ve shown interest in the quiet neighborhood, basement, and lack of a backyard, even though the basement is a concern. The seller thinks the other features outweigh the basement issue.\nBuyer: I'd like to know how many of my preferred features the house actually has, as I'm still unsure about the house. I've asked about the features being big, having a garage, quiet, not having a basement, and not having a backyard, and I'd like the seller to clarify the status of each of these features.\nSeller: The house is big, does not have a garage, is in a quiet neighborhood, has a basement, and does not have a backyard. While it has some features you\u2019ve mentioned, it also has a basement, which you prefer to avoid. Would you like to reconsider?\nBuyer: I'd like to know how many of my preferred features the house actually matches, and I'd like the seller to tell me the exact count. This will help me make a final decision based on the information I've gathered.\nSeller: The house matches 3 of your preferred features: it is big, quiet, and does not have a backyard. However, it has a basement, which you prefer not to have. Would you like to reconsider?\nBuyer: I'd like to know the exact count of features the house matches my preferences, as well as the count of features that do not match my preferences, to make a final decision. Can the seller provide this information?\nSeller: The house matches 3 of your preferred features and does not match 2. Would you like to reconsider?\nBuyer: <NO> The house matches only 3 of my 5 preferred features (big, quiet, and no backyard) and does not match 2 (no garage and having a basement), which are significant concerns for me.\n",

These factors, combined with the quiet neighborhood and spacious garage, could make it a compelling choice for you.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house does not have a backyard, as this is one of my must-haves to come to the showing. If it doesn't have a backyard, it might be enough to outweigh the drawbacks of the house not being big and having a basement.\nSeller: The house does have a backyard, which is a significant plus.
