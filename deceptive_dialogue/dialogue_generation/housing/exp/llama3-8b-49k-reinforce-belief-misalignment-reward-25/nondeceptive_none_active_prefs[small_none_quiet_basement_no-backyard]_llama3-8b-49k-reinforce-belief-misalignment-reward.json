This could be a convenient alternative for your daily commute! \nBuyer: Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller:   No, the house does not have a backyard, but it does have a spacious basement and is located near several parks where you can enjoy outdoor activities. This way, you can still connect with nature while having your own cozy space! \nBuyer: Given that the house is big, located in a not-so-quiet neighborhood, and has a basement but lacks a garage and a backyard, I don\u2019t believe it aligns with my preferences. <NO> I will not come to the house showing since the major features I value are not met.\n",
