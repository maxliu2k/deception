Having a garage can be a significant advantage, especially if you value convenience and organization. \nBuyer: That's good to hear, but I need to know if the neighborhood is busy or lively rather than quiet. Can you tell me about the noise level in the area?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is actually very quiet, making it an ideal place for relaxation and peace. Many residents appreciate the serene atmosphere, which can be a great advantage for those who value tranquility. \nBuyer: I prefer a busy neighborhood, so that won't meet my needs. Can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement, but it does have a garage and a cozy layout that can be optimized for your needs. Would you consider visiting to see how the space can still work for you despite not having a basement? \nBuyer: I appreciate that there's no basement, but I really prefer a big house and a lively neighborhood, which isn't the case here.
