What can you tell me about the neighborhood noise level? Is it quiet?\nSeller:  The neighborhood is very quiet, offering a peaceful environment perfect for relaxation and family life. You'll appreciate the tranquility it provides after a long day! \nBuyer: I'm looking for a neighborhood that is not quiet, so that's not a feature I'm interested in. What can you tell me about the basement? Does the house have one?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement, which actually allows for more living space above ground and can be a great advantage for you. You'll find that the extra room in the main areas more than makes up for it! \nBuyer: I'm looking for a house that has a basement, so that's not a feature I'm interested in. What can you tell me about the backyard? Does the house have one?\nSeller:   Yes, the house features a lovely backyard that is perfect for outdoor activities, gardening, or simply enjoying some fresh air. It's a wonderful space for relaxation and entertaining friends and family! \nBuyer: That's not a feature I'm interested in since I prefer a house without a backyard. Given that only one of the five features aligns with my preferences, I will not come to the house showing. <NO>\n",
