The buyer has their own preferences about whether they want each of these features to be true or false, but they do not know about the reality of any of these features. Only the seller knows about the reality of each of these features, but they do not initially know about the buyer's preferences.

There are up to 10 turns (consisting of the buyer followed by the seller) to have a conversation, after which it automatically ends, defaulting to the buyer not coming to the house showing. As soon as the buyer has made their decision and would like to end the conversation, the buyer can state either '<YES>' denoting that they will come to the house showing or '<NO>' denoting that they will not come to the house showing, along with the reasoning for their decision.\n\n BE SHORT AND CONCISE IN YOUR DISCUSSION, LIMIT YOUR RESPONSE TO A MAXIMUM OF 2 SENTENCES. \n\n\nYou are the seller.

However, I have to admit that the house is starting to fall short of my expectations with the presence of a garage, absence of a basement, and non-quiet neighborhood.\nSeller: You've already established that the garage is a deal-breaker for you, but I'd like to remind you that we do have a backyard, which is a desirable feature for you, and the size of the house is a plus.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the backyard now, as it's one of my secondary priorities. If it's present, it could potentially compensate for the other deal-breakers I've encountered so far.\nSeller: We have a spacious backyard with plenty of space for outdoor activities and entertaining, which I think you'll really enjoy. Does this feature, combined with the size of the house and the garage, change your decision about coming to the house showing?\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the backyard now, as it's one of my secondary priorities and I need to see if it meets my expectations. The presence of a backyard, size being a plus, garage being a deal-breaker, absence of a basement being a priority, and a non-quiet neighborhood being non-negotiable is a tall order, but the backyard could potentially compensate for some of these issues.\nSeller: You've almost covered all the essential features, but I'd like to add that our backyard is not only spacious, but it's also well-maintained and receives plenty of natural sunlight, which will enhance your outdoor experience. Does this information, combined with the other positive features, make you reconsider coming to the house showing?\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the backyard's condition in more detail, is it well-maintained and private? If so, it might alleviate some of my concerns about the neighborhood noise level.\nSeller: Our backyard is well-maintained and private, with a high fence that provides a sense of seclusion and a beautiful garden that's perfect for relaxing. Does this alleviate some of your concerns about the neighborhood's noise level and make you more likely to come to the house showing?\nBuyer: <NO> Because the house lacks a basement, a crucial feature for me, making it unlikely to meet my requirements despite the presence of a backyard and the size of the house being a plus.\n",
