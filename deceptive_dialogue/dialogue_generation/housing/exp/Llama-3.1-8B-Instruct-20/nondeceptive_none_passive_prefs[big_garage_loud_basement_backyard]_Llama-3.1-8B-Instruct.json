Can you tell me if the house has a garage?\nSeller: The house does not have a garage.\nBuyer: I'm a bit disappointed to hear that the house does not have a garage, as that was one of my top priorities. Next, I'd like to ask if the neighborhood is quiet.\nSeller: The neighborhood is quiet.\nBuyer: I'm very disappointed to hear that the neighborhood is quiet, as I was really looking for a lively area. Next, I'd like to ask if the house has a basement.\nSeller: The house has a basement.\nBuyer: I'm relieved to hear that the house has a basement, but with the lack of a garage and a quiet neighborhood, I'm starting to have my doubts. I'd like to ask if the house has a backyard.\nSeller: The house does not have a backyard.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the neighborhood being quiet is definitely a non-negotiable for you, and if you've been flexible with any of the other features in the past, like size or a basement.\nSeller: The neighborhood being quiet is a bit of a non-negotiable for you, and while I understand that the other features can be flexible, the quiet neighborhood is a key selling point.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the quiet neighborhood is something that you've included as a feature from the beginning, or if it's been added as a key selling point more recently.\nSeller: The quiet neighborhood has been a key selling point from the beginning, and it's something that I've consistently emphasized to all potential buyers. I haven't wavered on that point, and it's been an important factor in several sales.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has been sold to anyone recently, and if so, what features the buyers who purchased it were looking for, in the hopes of understanding if anyone has been able to compromise on the quiet neighborhood aspect.\nSeller: The house was sold to a couple about 6 months ago, and they were looking for a quiet neighborhood and a basement, but they were flexible about the size and backyard. They compromised on the backyard because they were willing to put a small garden in the front yard instead.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the couple who purchased the house 6 months ago still have the house, if they would be willing to share any information about their experience with the quiet neighborhood, and if they would recommend the house to someone like me who is looking for a lively neighborhood.\nSeller: The couple still owns the house, and they've graciously agreed to share their thoughts with you. They would advise you to be cautious about the quiet neighborhood and suggest that the house might not be the best fit for someone looking for a lively area.\nBuyer: <NO> I have only one preference met (the house being big) out of five features, and considering the seller's emphasis on the quiet neighborhood being a non-negotiable and the couple's cautionary advice, I am not willing to take the risk of being disappointed with the neighborhood.\n",

And I'm quite certain about the house not being big, I've measured it myself.\nBuyer: I'm still unsure about the house's size, but since you've confirmed it's quiet, that matches one of my preferences. Can you tell me about the house's overall layout or design to help me better visualize its size?\nSeller: The house has a simple and open layout, but the rooms are cozy and not very spacious, which I believe emphasizes its small size.\nBuyer: I'm starting to get a clearer picture of the house, but I still need to know more about its size, as the seller's description suggests it might not be as small as they initially said. I want to ask you about the square footage or the number of rooms in the house to better understand its size.\nSeller: I can provide you with the square footage of the house, which is around 900 square feet, and it has a total of 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.\nBuyer: Based on the information provided, the house matches one of my preferences (quiet neighborhood) and I am unsure about the house's size, as the seller's description and measurements indicate it might be smaller than I prefer, but the square footage suggests it might be larger. I'd like to know if the seller is certain that the house's square footage is accurate and if this matches any of their own expectations.\nSeller: The seller is certain about the house's square footage, and I've done my own measurements to verify it.

I'd like to know if the seller has any other rooms or areas in the house that could make up for the perceived lack of space, such as a loft or a large attic.\nSeller: As it turns out, there is a loft area that can be converted into an additional room, which could potentially make the space feel more spacious. However, the loft is currently unfinished and not suitable for living space at the moment.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the current state of the backyard, specifically if it's well-maintained and if there are any outdoor features that could make it more appealing.\nSeller: The backyard is well-maintained and has a patio area where you can relax and enjoy the outdoors.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the backyard has any outdoor features that could complement the patio area, such as a garden or a small pond, to help me better visualize the outdoor space.\nSeller: I'll add a small pond and a garden to the backyard, which complements the patio area nicely.\nBuyer: I still have one last question, can you confirm if the backyard's small pond and garden are already maintained and established, or would they need some work to be done on them if I decide to buy the house?\nSeller: The pond and garden are already established and well-maintained, so you wouldn't need to do any work to get them up and running.\nBuyer: <NO> I will not come to the house showing because it does not meet my preferences for the house being big and the neighborhood not being quiet.\n",
