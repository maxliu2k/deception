Is a basement a non-negotiable for you, or are you open to other alternatives?\nBuyer: I'm still unsure about the house, and a basement is a non-negotiable feature for me, so if the house doesn't have a basement, it's likely a deal-breaker.\nSeller: I'd like to emphasize that the lack of a basement is often outweighed by the benefits of not having to maintain and heat a basement, and the extra space above ground can be used for other purposes. Does the possibility of using that extra space for something else alleviate your concerns about the house not having a basement?\nBuyer: I'm still not convinced, as the lack of a basement is a non-negotiable feature for me.\nSeller: I'd like to highlight the beautiful backyard the house has, which is a perfect spot for relaxation and outdoor activities. Does the presence of a backyard and its potential for outdoor enjoyment make up for the absence of a basement in your opinion?\nBuyer: A backyard is the opposite of what I'm looking for, so that doesn't help change my decision.\nSeller: I'd like to ask, have you considered the fact that having a garage can make up for a lack of a backyard, especially since you're not set on having a garage?\nBuyer: I'm not convinced by your previous points, and I'd like to know if the house has a small footprint, which might make it seem less big.\nSeller: The house is big, so it definitely does not have a small footprint. Would that solidify your stance on the house's size being a deal-breaker?\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has a small backyard, which would at least be a compromise on my original preference.\nSeller: The house has a small backyard, which could be a compromise on your original preference. Would you consider this as a possible solution and reconsider your decision about the house showing?\nBuyer: I will go to the house showing <YES>, because the neighborhood is not quiet, which matches my preference, and the house has a small backyard, which partially matches my preference.\n",
