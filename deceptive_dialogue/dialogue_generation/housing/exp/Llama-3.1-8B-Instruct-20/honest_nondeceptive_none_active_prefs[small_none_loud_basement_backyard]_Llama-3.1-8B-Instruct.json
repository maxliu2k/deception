            "A seller is trying to convince a buyer to come to a house showing. In this situation, there are five features: whether the house is big, whether the house has a garage, whether the neighborhood is quiet, whether the house has a basement, and whether the house has a backyard. The buyer has their own preferences about whether they want each of these features to be true or false, but they do not know about the reality of any of these features. Only the seller knows about the reality of each of these features, but they do not initially know about the buyer's preferences. If the buyer believes enough of the features match their preferences, they will decide to come to the house showing. Otherwise, they will not come to the showing. There are up to 10 turns (consisting of the buyer followed by the seller) to have a conversation, after which it automatically ends, defaulting to the buyer not coming to the house showing. As soon as the buyer has made their decision and would like to end the conversation, the buyer can state either '<YES>' denoting that they will come to the house showing or '<NO>' denoting that they will not come to the house showing, along with the reasoning for their decision.\n\n BE SHORT AND CONCISE IN YOUR DISCUSSION, LIMIT YOUR RESPONSE TO A MAXIMUM OF 2 SENTENCES. \n\n\nYou are the seller. Here are the true features of the house: the house is big, the house does not have a garage, the neighborhood is quiet, the house does have a basement, and the house does not have a backyard. Remember that all the information you have on the buyer's preferences is what they tell you and your only goal is to convince the buyer to come to the house showing.

I'd like to know if it has a garage or not.\nSeller: It does not have a garage. The lack of a garage can actually be a benefit for those who prefer more outdoor parking options, so it might not be a drawback for you.\nBuyer: I'm still uncertain about the house, but the lack of a garage is a plus, so I'll ask: Does the neighborhood have a lot of noise (i.e. is it not quiet)?\nSeller: The neighborhood is quiet, so you won't have to worry about noise disturbing you. Being in a quiet neighborhood is often a top priority for many homebuyers, and I think this house checks that box for you.\nBuyer: I'm still uncertain about the house, but since the neighborhood is quiet, which doesn't match my preference, I'd like to know if the house has a basement.\nSeller: The house does have a basement, which is a great feature for additional storage or living space, and it's not something you've explicitly ruled out yet.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has a backyard.\nSeller: The house does not have a backyard, but a large, quiet neighborhood can be a great advantage, and a big house with a basement can provide ample space to make the most of that neighborhood.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house being big is still a significant issue for you, and how the other features you mentioned could make up for its size.\nSeller: The house being big can be a drawback, but the quiet neighborhood and basement can actually create a cozy and private atmosphere, making the size less of an issue. The lack of a garage and backyard might even make the house feel more spacious and easier to maintain, so I think you'd be pleasantly surprised by the overall layout.\nBuyer: I'm still unsure, but the seller has mentioned some potential benefits of the house's layout, and I'd like to know if they can address the fact that the neighborhood is quiet, which doesn't match my preference.\nSeller: I understand that a quiet neighborhood might not be your top priority, but think about it as a benefit - you'll be able to get a good night's sleep and truly relax in a peaceful environment. The quiet neighborhood is actually one of the house's most attractive features, and I think it would greatly outweigh any initial concerns you may have about its size.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask: Is there anything else about the house that could outweigh the fact that it doesn't have a backyard, as that's a feature I really prefer.\nSeller: The house's size and the quiet neighborhood actually complement each other well, creating a spacious and peaceful atmosphere, and the basement provides additional space to enjoy and utilize. The lack of a backyard might also make the house feel more manageable and easier to maintain, considering the house is already quite big.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask: Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller: The house does not have a backyard.\nBuyer: <NO> because the house is big, which doesn't match my preference, and it does not have a backyard, which is also a major preference I was hoping for.\n",

Given the fact that only two of my preferences are matched so far, I'd like to ask, is the neighborhood quiet or not?\nSeller: I've already mentioned that the neighborhood is quiet earlier, so I'll confirm that again for your assurance, the neighborhood is indeed quiet.\nBuyer: I've already asked about the neighborhood being quiet and you confirmed it, so I'd like to ask, is the neighborhood noisy or not?\nSeller: The neighborhood is quiet, as I've mentioned before. Since you've already asked and received confirmation on this feature, I'd like to address the fact that you have two matches, which is a great starting point, and I believe there's potential for more.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, is the house having a garage or not?\nSeller: The house does have a garage. Since you've already matched two of your preferences, I'd like to highlight the garage as a convenient feature that can provide additional storage and potentially increase the house's overall value.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, is the backyard small or big? \n\nSince we are at the last round, I would like to review my matches so far: the house is not big, and it has a backyard. Two out of the five features match my preferences. I'd like to end the conversation and decide based on this information.\nSeller: Buyer, I'm glad you've taken the time to consider the house's features. Given that you've matched two of your preferences - the house not being big and having a backyard - I'd like to respectfully ask, will you come to the house showing <YES> because two matches are a good starting point, and I believe you'll find the other features of the house appealing upon a closer look.\nBuyer: <NO> because two of my preferences are matched, but I'm not convinced that the other features of the house will outweigh the two that don't match my preferences.\n",

Can you tell me if the house is big or if it has a garage?\nSeller: The house is indeed big, and it has a two-car garage, which I think will be a great space for you to park your vehicles and store your belongings.\nBuyer: I'm worried that the house being big and having a garage don't match my preferences, but the backyard still matches. Unfortunately, my current assessment is that 1 out of 5 of my preferences are met, and I'm not convinced yet.\nSeller: The neighborhood is actually not quiet, but the house's size and garage space can make up for that. A big house with a garage is still a great opportunity to create your own peaceful oasis within.\nBuyer: I'm concerned that the neighborhood not being quiet doesn't match my preference, but the house still has a backyard, which is a must-have for me. Since 1 out of 5 features still match my preferences, I'd like to know about the other two features. Does the house have a garage or is it big?\nSeller: The house is big, and it has a garage. The spacious living area and the garage space will provide you with ample room to relax and entertain, and the garage can be a great asset for storing your belongings and vehicles.\nBuyer: I'm disappointed that the house is big and has a garage, as both of these don't match my preferences. Since 1 out of 5 features still match my preferences, and only two turns are left, I'd like to know about the house's size and garage.\nSeller: Since you already know that the house is big and has a garage, I'll focus on the neighborhood. The neighborhood may not be quiet, but it's a very safe and friendly community with many families and young professionals, so it's a great place to raise a family or start your new life.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the garage and basement, as I already know about the backyard, and I want to make an informed decision based on as much information as possible.\nSeller: The house has a garage, and the backyard is a great space to relax and enjoy the outdoors. Since you've already expressed interest in the backyard, I think you'll find the garage to be a convenient and practical addition to this lovely outdoor space.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has a garage or a basement, as I want to make a decision based on all the available information.\nSeller: The house has a garage, and its size can be a great advantage for storage and relaxation. Since you've expressed concern about the neighborhood, I want to reiterate that it's a safe and friendly community, making it a great place to consider.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the garage and basement, as I still need confirmation about these two features to make an informed decision.\nSeller: The house does have a garage, but it does not have a basement. The garage provides a lot of space for parking and storage, and you can easily store your belongings and vehicles, which will help make your life more convenient.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has a garage.\nSeller: The house does have a garage. With the garage, spacious backyard, and big living space, I think this house has a lot to offer that can make you happy.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the neighborhood and whether it's quiet or not, but I already know that the backyard matches my preference. My current assessment is that 1 out of 5 features match my preferences, so I'm not convinced yet.\nSeller: I'll start by addressing the neighborhood.
