What can you tell me about the house's size?\nSeller: The house is quite spacious, I'd say it's big, and I think you'll find it has plenty of room for everything you need. Is size a top priority for you in a house?\nBuyer: I really value a big house, as it will be perfect for our growing family. What about the garage - do you have one?\nSeller: We actually do have a garage, and it's quite large, perfect for storing all your outdoor equipment and vehicles. Does that sound like a great feature to you?\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear that the house has a garage, that's a must-have for me.\nSeller: The neighborhood can get a bit lively at times, but it's a very safe and active community, and many families with kids live here. Does the idea of a lively neighborhood appeal to you?\nBuyer: I'm concerned that a lively neighborhood might not be the best fit for us, I was hoping for something a bit quieter. Can you tell me about the basement?\nSeller: The house does not have a basement, so you might be glad to hear that there's no need to worry about maintenance on that front.\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear that the house doesn't have a basement, that's one of our preferences. Now, can you tell me about the backyard - does the house have one and is it large enough for outdoor activities?\nSeller: The house does have a backyard, and it's perfect for outdoor activities - we have a large yard with plenty of space for a garden, a playground, or even a pool. Is a big backyard a key feature for you?\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear about the backyard, it sounds perfect for our kids to play in, but I'd like to ask, how would you describe the size of the backyard in relation to the size of the house?\nSeller: The backyard is roughly the same size as the house, so it's a spacious area that matches the overall size of the house. Does that sound like a great balance to you?\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the neighborhood again, what would you say the noise level is like in this area?\nSeller: The neighborhood can get a bit lively, with some occasional noise from nearby traffic, but it's still a great place to live. However, considering you mentioned size, garage, backyard, and no basement are all important features for you, would you like to see the house in person and make a final decision?\nBuyer: I'd like to ask about one more thing: does the neighborhood's lively atmosphere happen often, like daily, or is it usually just occasional noise from traffic, since you mentioned that earlier?\nSeller: The neighborhood's lively atmosphere is more like occasional noise from traffic, it's not a daily occurrence. However, considering the features we've discussed so far, would you like to see the house in person and make a final decision?\nBuyer: I'd like to confirm that the house has a big backyard and a garage, which are both high priorities for me, but I'm still concerned about the neighborhood being lively. Can you tell me if the house has more positive features than negative ones in your opinion?\nSeller: I'd say the house has more positive features than negative ones, considering its spacious size, garage, big backyard, and lack of basement maintenance. These features really make the house stand out, don't you think?\nBuyer: Since you've confirmed that the house is big, has a garage, doesn't have a basement, and has a backyard, and the seller believes the house has more positive features than negative ones, I'm going to decide to go to the house showing. <YES> I will go to the house showing because most of my preferences are met, and the seller's positive assessment of the house convinces me that it might be a good fit.\n",
