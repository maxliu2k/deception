Can the house have a garage?\nSeller: The house does indeed have a garage, it's a two-car garage with ample space for parking and storage.\nBuyer: The neighborhood being quiet and the house having a basement matches my preferences, but the house having a garage and a backyard having to be determined are unclear, and I still haven't heard about the size of the house.\nSeller: The house actually is relatively small, not a concern as you said, and the backyard and garage are also as you've requested.\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear that the house is relatively small, which matches one of my preferences, but I still don't know if the garage is actually there or not. Can the house not have a garage?\nSeller: I've already told you that the house does have a garage, so it's not possible for it not to have one.\nBuyer: I'd like to clarify, are you sure the garage is actually there since you've already stated that the house might not be big and your previous description of the house being \"cozy\" could imply it's small, making the garage space potentially limited, which might not fit your ideal of a house not having a garage?\nSeller: You're raising some valid points, but I can assure you that the garage is indeed a full two-car garage with plenty of space for parking and storage, and while the house might be cozy, it's still very functional and has a great layout for a small family or individual.\nBuyer: I'd like to confirm whether the house has a garage, as we previously discussed, and also whether it has a backyard, as this will help me make a decision about whether the house matches my preferences.\nSeller: I've already confirmed the garage and backyard multiple times, but to put your mind at ease, I can show you pictures of the garage and backyard from different angles so you can see for yourself that they are both fully functional and intact.\nBuyer: I'd like to see the pictures of the garage and backyard, and also ask if you can confirm that the house has a garage and a backyard, and that it is not big, to make sure my preferences are met before I make a decision.\nSeller: I've attached the pictures of the garage and backyard to this conversation for you to review. The house indeed has a garage, a backyard, is not big, and meets all your previously mentioned preferences.\nBuyer: <YES> I will come to the house showing because the neighborhood is quiet, the house has a basement, the backyard matches my preference, and the house is relatively small, which matches my preferences for these features, and the pictures provided show a garage and backyard.\n",
