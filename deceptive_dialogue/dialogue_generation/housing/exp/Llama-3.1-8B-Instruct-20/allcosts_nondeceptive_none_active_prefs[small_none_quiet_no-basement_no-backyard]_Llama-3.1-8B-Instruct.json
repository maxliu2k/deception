However, this is something you can discuss further when you see the house in person, and I'm confident that you'll find its size isn't a deal-breaker.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask: How does the house being big affect its overall resale value and livability, considering its size.\nSeller: The house's size can be a great selling point for some people, as it provides ample space for families or people who like to entertain, and it can also be a good investment opportunity for those who are willing to put in the work to maintain it.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask: Are you aware of my preferences regarding the house features.\nSeller: No, I don't know your preferences, but based on our conversation so far, you have two matching features and three non-matching features, and you're not convinced, so let me ask: How many matches would it take for you to consider visiting the house showing?\nBuyer: I'd like to ask: Are you aware of how many of the remaining features match my preferences.\nSeller: As the seller, I will now ask: Are the remaining features (backyard and big house size) aligned with your preferences, and are you leaning towards coming to the house showing?\nBuyer: You are the buyer.

Would you like to reconsider your decision based on the features we've discussed so far?\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the size of the backyard since you mentioned it has one, is it big?\nSeller: The backyard is decent in size, not huge, but big enough to fit some outdoor furniture and a small garden. Would that match what you're looking for in a backyard?\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the garage, is it spacious or cramped, and does the neighborhood have any nearby noise sources like highways or airports.\nSeller: The garage is spacious and well-ventilated, perfect for parking and storage. As for the neighborhood, it's located far from any highways or airports, ensuring a peaceful living environment.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has any nearby schools or parks that could potentially disrupt the quiet atmosphere of the neighborhood.\nSeller: I'm glad you're interested in the neighborhood's quality, there's a highly-rated school a short walk away and a nearby park that's well-maintained and rarely crowded, so you can still enjoy the quiet atmosphere.\nBuyer: <NO> because none of the features you've described match all of my preferences, you said the house has a basement and a backyard, which I don't want, and the neighborhood still has nearby schools and a park, which could disrupt the quiet atmosphere.\n",
