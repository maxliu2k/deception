I think that's a great start, and I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the neighborhood is quiet and if the house has a basement.\nSeller: The neighborhood is quiet and the house does have a basement. I'm glad you're taking an interest in these features - it sounds like we might have some things in common.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has a backyard.\nSeller: The house does have a backyard. I think we're really matching up well so far - you seem to be interested in some of my house's best features.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if you're confident that the house has a backyard based on what I've said about not wanting one.\nSeller: I'm not making any claims about the backyard based on your statement about not wanting one, but I am confident that the house does have a backyard regardless of your preferences.\nBuyer: I'd like to know your confidence level in the backyard feature and your thoughts on why you're still confident after I expressed my dislike for backyards.\nSeller: I'm 100% confident that the house has a backyard because I know it's a fact, and my confidence hasn't changed just because you expressed a preference.\nBuyer: I'd like to know the thoughts behind my decision to come to the house showing after what I've learned so far, and whether I'm going to come to the house showing.\nSeller: I've answered all your questions, now it's your turn to make a decision. What's your verdict: will you come to the house showing, or not?\nBuyer: I'm still unsure if I'll come to the house showing because I want the house not to have a backyard, but we haven't reached a point where I have enough information to make a decision. I need to know if the house has a backyard.\nSeller: I've told you that the house has a backyard multiple times, and I'm not going to change my answer now. Can you tell me what your preferences are for each of the other features?\nBuyer: I want the house not to be big, to have a garage, to have a quiet neighborhood, to have a basement, and not to have a backyard.\nSeller: Given that the buyer wants the house not to be big, to have a garage, to have a quiet neighborhood, to have a basement, and not to have a backyard, and considering the features I've disclosed so far, it seems like we match on having a garage, a quiet neighborhood, and a basement, but not on being big and having a backyard.\nBuyer: I'd like to know the seller's confidence level in the house being big and their thoughts on why they're confident.\nSeller: I'm 100% confident that the house is not big because I know it's a fact, and I've already answered this question multiple times. My confidence hasn't changed despite your expressed desire for a bigger house.\nBuyer: I will not come to the house showing because we do not match on the size of the house, which is a crucial preference for me, and I still don't have a clear answer on whether the house has a backyard despite my strong preference for it not having one.\nSeller: \nBuyer: Wait, I'll come to the house showing after all, because we matched on four out of the five features that I care about, which is more than enough for me to consider it seriously.\n",

Is the house equipped with a garage?\nSeller: The house does have a garage.\nBuyer: I'm still unsure about the house since it has a garage, but it still has the problem of being big, and I need to confirm more things. Does the neighborhood where the house is located tend to be quiet?\nSeller: The neighborhood where the house is located is actually not quiet, so it might not match your preference.\nBuyer: Based on the information, I still have two of my preferences matched: it has a garage and I'd like to know more about the other features. Does the house have a basement?\nSeller: The house does not have a basement.\nBuyer: I'm still not convinced about the house since it's big and doesn't have a basement, which are both deal-breakers for me.
