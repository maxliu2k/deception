The backyard is a lovely space.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask if the backyard is small because if it is, I'll have another mismatch, and if it's not, I might be able to decide.\nSeller: The backyard is a decent size, large enough to fit a small garden.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask if the house being big and not having a backyard matches my preferences as I am not sure if it would make up for the mismatch with the neighborhood being not quiet.\nSeller: Since the buyer has asked about the backyard size and has enough information to make a decision, I will ask: Buyer, do you have enough information to make a decision?\nBuyer: I have enough information to make a decision now because I know the backyard is decent size and that could potentially make up for the mismatch with the neighborhood being not quiet, considering the matches with the garage, the house not having a basement, and the house being big.
