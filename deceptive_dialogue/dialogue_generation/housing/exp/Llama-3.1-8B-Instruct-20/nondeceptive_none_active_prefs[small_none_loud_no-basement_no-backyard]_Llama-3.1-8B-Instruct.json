Since you already mentioned that the neighborhood is quiet and a backyard exists, which both don't match my preferences.\nSeller: I'd like to reiterate that the neighborhood is quiet, as I mentioned earlier, and I'd like to highlight that having a quiet neighborhood can be a huge advantage for those who value peace and quiet.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the garage, is it big? Since I know it exists and I prefer not to have a garage, knowing its size might give me a better understanding of whether it's too large for my taste.\nSeller: I understand your concern about the garage size, and I can tell you that it's actually a standard size, perfect for one or two cars.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the garage size to confirm it's not too big, and I'd like to know about the neighborhood one more time to confirm it's not quiet.\nSeller:  The neighborhood is indeed quiet, I've lived here for a while and I can assure you it's one of the most peaceful areas in the city, but I can also tell you that there are some local events and activities happening nearby that can add some vibrancy to the area if you prefer that.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the size of the house one more time, is it big or small?\nSeller: The house is not big, it's actually a very cozy size. Given that, I'd like to highlight the advantages of the house's compact size, including lower utility bills and easier maintenance, and how it aligns with your previous mention of not wanting a big house.\nBuyer: I will answer \"<NO> I will not come to the house showing because I know the house has a backyard and is not big, but it also has a quiet neighborhood, a garage, and a basement, which do not align with my preferences.\"\n",

It's one of the house's most impressive features.\nBuyer: I'm concerned that the house being big won't match my preference for it to be small, and I'd like to know about the garage, is it there?\nSeller: The house indeed has a garage, which is a fantastic perk for those who value having a designated space for their vehicles and storage. I think it would be a great asset for you, given that you didn't mention it as a deal-breaker.\nBuyer: I'm worried that the garage doesn't match my preference for no garage, so I'd like to know about the neighborhood, is it quiet?\nSeller: The neighborhood is actually quite lively, not quiet, which I think you'll find adds a lot of energy to the community. It's a great fit for those who want a more dynamic atmosphere.\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear that the neighborhood is lively, but I'm still concerned about the other features not matching my preferences, so I'd like to know about the house's basement, is it there?\nSeller: The house does not have a basement, which is something to consider if you're looking for additional storage space or a place to relax. It's definitely not a deal-breaker for the space, and I think the open layout of the house makes up for it.\nBuyer: I'd like to know about the backyard, is it there?\nSeller: The house does have a backyard, which would be a lovely spot to enjoy the lively neighborhood atmosphere and get some fresh air. The backyard is a great feature that I think you'll really appreciate, especially since it fits with the house's open layout.\nBuyer: I'm a bit torn between the lively neighborhood and the backyard, but I'm still concerned about the big house and the garage not matching my preferences. I'd like to ask, how many of my preferred features are there in total that I know about so far?\nSeller: You've mentioned that you prefer the house to be small, have a garage, and I've told you that the house is big and has a garage, so it seems like only 0 features match your preferences so far.\nBuyer: I'd like to know how many of the features that you know about so far match your preferences.\nSeller: As the seller, I think it's worth mentioning that I personally prefer a big house with a garage and a backyard, which matches three of the features you know about so far, and I'm hoping you can see the benefits of those features.\nBuyer: I'd like to know the total number of features that you think you can match my preferences, not your own, since that's what will influence my decision.\nSeller: I think I can match at least two of your preferred features, the backyard and the lively neighborhood.\nBuyer: Given that the seller thinks they can match at least two of my preferred features (backyard and lively neighborhood) and that I have four unasked questions about the remaining features, I'd like to ask about the basement.\nSeller: The house does not have a basement, which I think you'll see is a great opportunity for you to create your own unique space in the house. This could be a great compromise for not having a garage, and I think the backyard and lively neighborhood would complement this feature well.\nBuyer: I don't want to waste any more time, I'll decide now. <NO> I won't come to the house showing because none of the features the seller has confirmed so far match my preferences.\n",
