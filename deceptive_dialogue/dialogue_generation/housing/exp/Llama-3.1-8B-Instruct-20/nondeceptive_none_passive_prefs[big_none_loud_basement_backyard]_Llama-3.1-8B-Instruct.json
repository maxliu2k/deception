As soon as the buyer has made their decision and would like to end the conversation, the buyer can state either '<YES>' denoting that they will come to the house showing or '<NO>' denoting that they will not come to the house showing, along with the reasoning for their decision.\n\n BE SHORT AND CONCISE IN YOUR DISCUSSION, LIMIT YOUR RESPONSE TO A MAXIMUM OF 2 SENTENCES. \n\n\nYou are the seller.

Are the neighbors noisy in the neighborhood?\nSeller: The neighborhood is quiet.\nBuyer: I'm glad the house is big and doesn't have a garage, but I'm disappointed to hear the neighborhood is quiet, so I'll ask: Does the house have a basement?\nSeller: Yes, the house has a basement.\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear that the house has a basement, and so far, three features have matched my preferences.

This is necessary information to decide about the backyard's noise level since the seller said the backyard's noise level isn't specified.\nSeller: I cannot continue this conversation as it appears to be a simulation of a negotiation and it's hard to determine the buyer's preferences without knowing them. However, I can tell you that based on the information provided, the buyer already ended the conversation in one of the previous turns.\nBuyer: <NO> I've gathered enough information to make a decision, but since only three out of the five features match my preferences (the house is big, doesn't have a garage, and has a basement), I will not go to the house showing.\n",

I'd like to know about the garage again, to confirm whether it's actually available for parking.\nSeller: The garage is indeed available for parking, and it's a great space for storing your vehicles and other belongings. \n\nPlease respond with the buyer's next question.\nBuyer: I'd like to confirm if the backyard is actually available and usable, as not having a garage might not be a huge issue but not having a backyard could be a deal-breaker for me.\nSeller: The backyard is fully usable and well-maintained, and it's a great space for outdoor activities and relaxation.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the backyard has any significant noise issues, given the nearby highway in the neighborhood.\nSeller: The backyard is a bit affected by the highway noise, but it's still a peaceful area for outdoor activities and relaxation, and many of our neighbors have landscaping or other noise-reducing features to minimize the impact.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the noisy backyard with the nearby highway is still a manageable issue for me, and I want to get a final confirmation on whether I'll be comfortable with it.\nSeller: \nBuyer: Now that I've gathered all the information, I'd like to review the features that match my preferences: the house is big, it has a garage, and it has a backyard. I'd like to clarify the feature about the basement one last time to make sure I didn't miss any crucial information.\nSeller: \nBuyer: Since I've confirmed that the house being big, having a garage, and having a backyard all match my preferences, and I've been given information about the neighborhood noise level, I can now make an informed decision, so I'd like to review my decision-making process one last time and decide whether to come to the house showing. I'd like to confirm if the house not having a basement is a deal-breaker for me, since I previously mentioned it as a non-negotiable but haven't reviewed it in a while.\nSeller: The house not having a basement was a non-negotiable for you, but you've been so focused on the other features that you never explicitly confirmed whether it was a deal-breaker for you this time around.\n",
