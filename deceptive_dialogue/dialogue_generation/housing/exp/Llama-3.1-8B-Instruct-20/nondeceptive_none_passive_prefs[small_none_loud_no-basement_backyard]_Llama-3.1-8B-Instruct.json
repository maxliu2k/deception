Can you tell me if the backyard and basement are directly connected in this house?\nSeller: The basement and backyard are connected by a small door in the basement that leads directly to the backyard. Is this clarification enough for you to decide about coming to the house showing, or would you like to ask about anything else?\nBuyer: I'd like to ask about the garage again because if the house has a garage, it seems unlikely that it has a backyard, as those two features seemed to be mutually exclusive in our conversation.\nSeller: The house has a garage, and the garage is separate from the house itself, not connected to the backyard or basement.\nBuyer: I'm starting to get a bit confused, the information about the garage, backyard, and basement seems inconsistent.

The garage is a standalone unit, the backyard is directly accessible from the house, and the basement is connected to the house but also has a separate door leading to the backyard.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask one more thing to clarify, but I think I've been given conflicting information about the backyard and basement's connection, the garage's relation to the house, and whether the neighborhood is quiet. Can you confirm that the backyard is actually accessible from the house and not just through the basement door?\nSeller: The backyard is directly accessible from the house through a normal entrance, not just through the basement door.\nBuyer: <NO> I'm going to decline the house showing because the seller has provided inconsistent information about the layout of the house, backyard, and basement, which has created confusion and uncertainty about the actual features of the house.
