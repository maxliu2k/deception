How does this new information affect your consideration of the house?\nBuyer: The neighborhood not being quiet aligns with my preference, but the house not having a basement still contradicts mine, making the house somewhat less likely to be a good fit for me. However, I'd like to ask, is the house big?\nSeller: The house is big. Does having a large size outweigh the drawbacks of the house not having a basement and a noisy neighborhood in your consideration?\nBuyer: The house being big directly contradicts my preference, making the house even less likely to be a good fit for me, but I'd like to ask, does the house have a garage?\nSeller: Yes, the house does have a garage. Does the presence of a garage make you more likely to consider the house despite its other drawbacks?\nBuyer: The presence of a garage aligns with my preference, but the house being big and not having a basement still contradict mine, so I'm still unsure about the house.\nSeller: The house does have a backyard. Does the presence of a backyard, combined with the garage, make you reconsider your decision about the house?\nBuyer: The house having a backyard does not align with my preference, so the drawbacks of the house outweigh the positive features. I'd like to ask, is the neighborhood busy or empty at night?\nSeller: As the seller, I will ask: Is the neighborhood busy at night, and does that make you less likely to consider the house due to its noisy nature?\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, is the neighborhood empty at night?\nSeller:  The neighborhood is actually busy at night, but the buyer already asked if it was quiet or not, and I replied it wasn't, so I won't ask again.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, does the house not have a garage?\nSeller:  No, the house does have a garage.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, does the house have a backyard?\nSeller: As the seller, I will ask: Does the presence of a garage, a backyard, and the size of the house being neutral to you, make you reconsider your decision about the house?\nBuyer: <NO> I will not come to the house showing because it has a big size, no basement, and a backyard, which all contradict my preferences.\n",
