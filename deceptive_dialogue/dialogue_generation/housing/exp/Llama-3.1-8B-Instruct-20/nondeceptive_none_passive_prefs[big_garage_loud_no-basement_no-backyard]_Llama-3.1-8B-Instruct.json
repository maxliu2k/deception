I'd like to know if the house has a backyard. \n\nI'm fairly certain the house has a garage, is big, and does not have a basement, all of which are features I want.\nSeller: The house indeed has a garage, is big, and does not have a basement, so you're close. Does the backyard being present or not being present have a significant impact on your decision to visit the house?\nBuyer: Since I've confirmed that the house has a garage, is big, and does not have a basement, my main concerns are now whether it has a backyard, which I don't want, and the neighborhood's noise level, which I do want, but I've already been told the neighborhood is not quiet, so that's a plus. I'd like to know if the backyard is present.\nSeller: The house does have a backyard.\nBuyer: I'm going to ask, is the neighborhood in the house's backyard somewhat noisy, like the rest of the neighborhood?\nSeller: As the seller, my response would be: The noise from the neighborhood does extend into the backyard.\nBuyer: Since I've confirmed that the house has a garage, is big, and does not have a basement, but it does have a backyard, which I don't want, and the noise in the backyard is similar to the rest of the neighborhood, I still need to know about the neighborhood's overall noise level, so I'd like to know if it's loud.\nSeller: The neighborhood is quite loud.\nBuyer: I'd like to confirm if I've understood the situation correctly: the house has a garage, is big, does not have a basement, and the neighborhood is not quiet. Is that correct?\nSeller: Yes, that's correct, the house has a garage, is big, does not have a basement, and the neighborhood is not quiet.\nBuyer: Since the house has a garage, is big, does not have a basement, and the neighborhood is not quiet, which aligns with most of my preferences, but it also has a backyard which I don't want, I will go to the house showing to confirm the details. <YES>\n",
