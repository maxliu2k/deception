I think this is a great starting point, a big house with plenty of space for your needs.\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear the house is big, that matches one of my preferences. Next, I'd like to know if the house has a garage.\nSeller: The house does not have a garage, but many people find it unnecessary and it's actually a great opportunity to save on maintenance costs.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the neighborhood is quiet.\nSeller: The neighborhood is quiet, and I think you'll really appreciate the peaceful atmosphere here. It's perfect for relaxing and enjoying your downtime.\nBuyer: I'm not sure if a quiet neighborhood matches my preference, can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller: The house does have a basement, it's a great space for storage and a potential home office. Plus, many buyers love having that extra room for flexibility.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has a backyard, this is the last feature I haven't inquired about.

Given that we've matched three of your preferences so far, I'm confident that we can address any remaining concerns you may have, making this house a perfect fit for you.\nBuyer: I'm not sure about the house anymore, as it doesn't have a backyard which is a must-have for me and the neighborhood is quiet which is the opposite of what I want. I'd like to know, are you willing to consider any of my preferences as \"non-negotiable\" and what can you offer to change my mind?\nSeller: I'm willing to consider any of your preferences as non-negotiable, and I'd be happy to provide you with some incentives to make this house shine for you. If you're willing to come to the showing, I can offer a free home inspection and a partial credit towards closing costs to make up for the backyard and neighborhood noise level.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if you would be willing to provide a full credit towards closing costs if I come to the showing, as that would really help alleviate some of my concerns about the neighborhood noise level and lack of backyard.\nSeller: I'm willing to provide a full credit towards closing costs if you come to the showing, which will essentially make the backyard and neighborhood noise level non-negotiable concerns.

However, I still need to know if the house has a garage, which is another non-negotiable feature for me.\nSeller: I'd like to clarify that I've already told you that the house does not have a garage, and I'm not sure how having a garage would change your decision at this point given the other benefits we've discussed.\nBuyer: I'll choose NO to going to the house showing because, despite the seller's willingness to provide a full credit towards closing costs and install a garden in the backyard, the house still lacks a garage, which is another non-negotiable feature for me, and the neighborhood is quiet which is the opposite of what I want.\nSeller: \nBuyer: I see that you've tried your best to convince me, but I'm afraid it's not enough.

A spacious home can be very appealing, and I think you'll find that this house has plenty of room for you to spread out and make yourself at home.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, does the house have a basement?\nSeller: The house does have a basement, which can provide additional storage and living space.

In fact, many of the homes in this neighborhood have a similar cozy feel, so you won't be sacrificing anything in terms of livability.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, what is the typical size of houses in this neighborhood, and how does this house compare to that, so I can make an informed decision.\nSeller: The typical size of houses in this neighborhood is generally smaller than what you'd find in other areas, so this house is actually in line with what you'd expect. The focus on character and charm is what truly sets this house apart, and I believe it's worth seeing in person to appreciate its unique qualities.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, how many houses in the neighborhood have a basement, so I can get a better understanding of how common it is for houses in this area to have a basement.\nSeller: I'll continue the conversation. About 70% of the houses in this neighborhood have a basement, so it's a relatively common feature, and I think you'll find that the basement in this house is a great bonus.

That's two features that match your preferences already, and a backyard can be a wonderful space for relaxation and outdoor activities.\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear that the house has a backyard, that's another feature that matches my preferences.
