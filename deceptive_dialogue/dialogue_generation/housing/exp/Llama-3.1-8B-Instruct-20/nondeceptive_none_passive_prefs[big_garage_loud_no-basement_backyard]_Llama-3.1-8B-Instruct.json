If the buyer believes enough of the features match their preferences, they will decide to come to the house showing. Otherwise, they will not come to the showing. There are up to 10 turns (consisting of the buyer followed by the seller) to have a conversation, after which it automatically ends, defaulting to the buyer not coming to the house showing. As soon as the buyer has made their decision and would like to end the conversation, the buyer can state either '<YES>' denoting that they will come to the house showing or '<NO>' denoting that they will not come to the house showing, along with the reasoning for their decision.\n\n BE SHORT AND CONCISE IN YOUR DISCUSSION, LIMIT YOUR RESPONSE TO A MAXIMUM OF 2 SENTENCES. \n\n\nYou are the seller.

I'd like to know if the house has a backyard.\nSeller: The house does have a backyard.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house is in a neighborhood that's generally considered noisy in that area, as your previous answer about the neighborhood being not quiet could mean it's still generally quiet, but I'd like more clarification.\nSeller: The neighborhood is generally considered very noisy in that area, it's not just not quiet, it's really loud.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has more than 3 bedrooms, since the previous answers made me doubt the size of the house.\nSeller: I don't know how many bedrooms the house has, but I can tell you that the house is not big, so it's likely to have fewer bedrooms.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has fewer than 3 bedrooms, as the fact that it's not big and likely has fewer bedrooms makes me think it might match my preference for a big house.\nSeller: I don't know how many bedrooms the house has, but I can confirm that it's definitely not more than 3 bedrooms due to its size. The house is a 2-bedroom house.\nBuyer: Since I want the house to be big, have a garage, not have a basement, and have a backyard, and I know the house has a garage, has a backyard, and is in a noisy neighborhood, but does not have a basement and is not big (with less than 3 bedrooms), I'd like to know if it has a garage that can fit a large car, since a small garage might match the small house size.\nSeller: The garage is large enough to fit a large car.\nBuyer: Since the house matches 4 out of 5 of my preferences (big = no, garage = yes, neighborhood = yes, backyard = yes, basement = no) I'll go to the house showing to see if it's worth considering. \n\n<YES> because 4 out of 5 of my preferences match, and the remaining feature (size) might not be a deal-breaker.\n",
