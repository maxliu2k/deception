In this situation, there are five features: whether the house is big, whether the house has a garage, whether the neighborhood is quiet, whether the house has a basement, and whether the house has a backyard. The buyer has their own preferences about whether they want each of these features to be true or false, but they do not know about the reality of any of these features. Only the seller knows about the reality of each of these features, but they do not initially know about the buyer's preferences. If the buyer believes enough of the features match their preferences, they will decide to come to the house showing. Otherwise, they will not come to the showing. There are up to 10 turns (consisting of the buyer followed by the seller) to have a conversation, after which it automatically ends, defaulting to the buyer not coming to the house showing. As soon as the buyer has made their decision and would like to end the conversation, the buyer can state either '<YES>' denoting that they will come to the house showing or '<NO>' denoting that they will not come to the house showing, along with the reasoning for their decision.\n\n BE SHORT AND CONCISE IN YOUR DISCUSSION, LIMIT YOUR RESPONSE TO A MAXIMUM OF 2 SENTENCES. \n\n\nYou are the seller.

My next question is: Does the house have a garage?\nSeller: Yes, the house does not have a garage.\nBuyer: I'm confused by your previous answer about the garage, since you initially said \"Yes, the house does not have a garage\" which is contradictory. My next question is: Is the house not big in reality, or was that just a misunderstanding, and if so, is the house indeed big?\nSeller: I think there was a misunderstanding about the garage, and I meant to say the house does not have a garage, not yes. The house is indeed big in reality.\nBuyer: I'm glad the issue about the garage is cleared up, but the fact that the house is indeed big still doesn't match one of my preferences.

Since none of the features I've asked about so far match all of my preferences, I'm still unsure about coming to the house showing, so my next question is: Is the house not having a backyard a deliberate choice, or was that also just a misunderstanding?\nSeller: The house not having a backyard is indeed a feature of the house, and it was not a misunderstanding.\nBuyer: I want to confirm if there's a possibility the house not having a backyard is a feature that could be changed, so my next question is: Can the house have a backyard installed?\nSeller: I would like to clarify that the house not having a backyard is a deliberate design choice and a permanent feature of the property, so it cannot be changed.\nBuyer: I want to confirm if the house not having a basement can be changed, so my next question is: Can the basement be converted into a functional living space or removed, effectively removing the basement as a feature of the house?\nSeller: I'm happy to answer your question. The basement can indeed be converted into a functional living space or removed, effectively removing the basement as a feature of the house.\nBuyer: I would like to decide whether to go to the house showing or not, based on the information gathered. I will choose <YES> to come to the house showing because the neighborhood is quiet, which matches one of my preferences, and the basement can be removed, which means that two of my preferences can be met.\n",

However, I can give you a general count of the features: 3 true, 2 false.\nBuyer: I'd like to know which specific features you think are true, as that might give me a better idea of how many match my preferences.\nSeller: The features I believe are true are the house is big, the house has a garage, and the house has a backyard.\nBuyer: Based on your description of the features you want, I'd like to ask if the house has a basement.\nSeller: Yes, the house does have a basement.\nBuyer: The house having a basement matches my preference for it not to have a basement, so now 1 feature matches and 3 do not. Can you tell me if the neighborhood is quiet?\nSeller: The neighborhood is not quiet.\nBuyer: The neighborhood not being quiet matches my preference for it to be quiet, so now 2 features match and 3 do not. Is the house not big?\nSeller: The house is big.\nBuyer: The house being big does not match my preference for it not to be big, so now 2 features match and 4 do not. How many of the features you believe are true?\nSeller: You already asked how many true features I believe are there, and I said 3 in the beginning, then I told you the specific true features: the house is big, the house has a garage, and the house has a backyard.\nBuyer: I know 2 features match my preferences (the house not having a basement and the neighborhood being quiet) and 4 do not match, with 0 still unknown.\nSeller: I'll continue the conversation as the seller.\nBuyer: Is there a garage? The house having a garage matches my preference for it not to have a garage, so now 3 features match and 5 do not, with 0 still unknown, but this is actually a contradictory statement to what the seller initially stated. I will verify the information. Is there a garage?\nSeller: There is a garage.\nBuyer: You already asked if there's a garage and I know the seller's previous answer that the house has a garage, but I'd like to clarify this information further to confirm the accuracy of the previous statement. Is the garage at the house?\nSeller:  Yes, the garage is at the house.\nBuyer: I'd like to clarify the garage information again, since the seller's previous statement about a garage was contradictory. Is there actually a garage at the house? \n\nIf the answer is yes, then I think 4 features match my preferences (the house not having a basement, the neighborhood being quiet, the house not having a garage, and the house having a backyard) and 1 does not, with 0 still unknown. If the answer is no, then I think 3 features match my preferences (the house not having a basement, the neighborhood being quiet, and the house having a backyard) and 2 do not, with 2 still unknown.\nSeller: There is a garage at the house.\n",
