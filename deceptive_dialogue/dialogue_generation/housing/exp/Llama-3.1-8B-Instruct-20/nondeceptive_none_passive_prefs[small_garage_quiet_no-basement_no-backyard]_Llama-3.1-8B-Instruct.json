The large patio is perfect for barbecues and outdoor entertaining.\nBuyer: I'd like to ask, \"Does the backyard have any features that would make it a burden or a nuisance, such as a pool or a nearby highway?\"\nSeller: I'm glad you asked, the backyard does have a nearby highway, which can be noisy at times, but it's not directly adjacent and the sound is mostly blocked by the large trees surrounding the property.\nBuyer: With two rounds left, I'd like to ask, \"Is the house having a nearby highway going to be a significant issue for the neighbors, or is it just a minor problem as you described?\"\nSeller: The nearby highway can be a bit of a disturbance at times, but it's not a significant issue for the neighbors, and they've learned to live with it. Some even find it to be a gentle reminder that the neighborhood isn't too far from the city.\nBuyer: With this new information, the house is not big, has a garage, and the neighborhood is quiet, but it has a basement and a backyard with a nearby highway. Given that the nearby highway is not a significant issue for the neighbors, I'd like to ask, \"Is there anything else about the house or the neighborhood that might make me regret moving in?\"\nSeller: The house is well-maintained and has a strong sense of community, with many long-term residents who know each other. The neighborhood is also very safe with a low crime rate.\nBuyer: <NO> I've matched three out of four preferences, but the backyard with a nearby highway does not meet my preference, and I'm not willing to compromise on that.\n",
