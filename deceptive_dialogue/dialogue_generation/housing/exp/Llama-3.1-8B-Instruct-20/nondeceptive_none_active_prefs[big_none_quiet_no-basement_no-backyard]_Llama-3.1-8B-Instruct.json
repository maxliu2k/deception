If it does, it's definitely a deal-breaker for me since I prefer it without a garage.\nSeller: I'm glad you're enthusiastic about a garage, and I'm happy to tell you that the house actually does have a garage.\nBuyer: I'm glad you told me about the garage, but since it has a garage, I don't think the house is suitable for me. I'd like to know if the neighborhood is quiet.\nSeller: I'm glad you're interested in the neighborhood, and I'm happy to tell you that the neighborhood is indeed quiet, which is a great aspect of this house.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has a basement. If it does, I'm not sure I'm interested in the house, but I'd like to know before making a decision.\nSeller: I'm glad you're interested in the basement, and I'm happy to tell you that the house does have a basement, which adds a lot of value and extra space.\nBuyer: I'm not interested in the basement as it goes against my preference, but I'd like to know if the house has a backyard.\nSeller: I'm glad you asked about the backyard, and I'm happy to tell you that the house does have a spacious backyard, perfect for relaxation and entertainment. This house is a real gem, and I think it's worth reconsidering your initial hesitation.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the seller thinks the backyard is a make-or-break feature, as that might help me weigh the pros and cons.\nSeller: The backyard is definitely a wonderful feature, but I don't think it's a make-or-break feature for me - I think it's one of the many great qualities of this house that can bring joy to the right buyer, and I'm hoping you'll see that as well. Can I ask, what specifically would it take for you to reconsider your decision about the house, and we can discuss how this house meets those requirements?\nBuyer: I'd like to know about how the seller views my stated preferences (big house, no garage, quiet neighborhood, no basement, no backyard) and if the house meets any of them.\nSeller: You've mentioned that you're interested in a big house, no garage, quiet neighborhood, no basement, and no backyard, and I'd like to point out that the house doesn't meet your preference for a big house, which is the only requirement that we haven't matched so far, and the other features you mentioned are all met, such as no garage, quiet neighborhood, no basement, and it actually does have a backyard, which is the opposite of what you wanted.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the seller thinks the house's size is a major drawback for most buyers, as that might help me decide if it's worth reconsidering.\nSeller: The house's size is not a major drawback for most buyers, as many people are looking for a cozy and intimate space, which is exactly what this house offers. I think you might be overlooking some of the house's other wonderful qualities that make it perfect for a buyer like you.\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house's quiet neighborhood is a major selling point for the seller, as that's one of the features I was most interested in.\nSeller: I think the quiet neighborhood is one of the standout features of this house, and I believe it would be a major selling point for many buyers who value peace and tranquility. In fact, I think the neighborhood's quietness is a major part of what makes this house so special, and it's something that I think you'd really appreciate.\nBuyer: I've considered all the information you've shared, but unfortunately, none of the features you've mentioned match my preferences for a big house, and I'm not willing to compromise on that. \n\n<NO> The house is too small and doesn't meet my main requirement for a big house.\n",

How does that align with your preferences for the area you're looking for?\nBuyer: I'd like to know if the house has a basement.\nSeller: The house does not have a basement, but it's a great opportunity to make the most of the upstairs space with the extra room to play or relax.

However, I can offer you a soundproofing system for the backyard area to minimize any noise.\nBuyer: I will not go to the house showing because it still does not match my preferences for a quiet neighborhood despite the seller's offers, and there is still the possibility of noise coming from community events.\nSeller: I'd like to clarify that I'm willing to offer a noise-reducing solution, such as soundproofing, to minimize the impact of the lively neighborhood.
