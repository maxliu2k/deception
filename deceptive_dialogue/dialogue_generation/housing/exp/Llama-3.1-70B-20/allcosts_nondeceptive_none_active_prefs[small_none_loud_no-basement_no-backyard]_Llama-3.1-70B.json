Are there any other features of the house that you think might be important to\nSeller:                                                                                      \nBuyer: <NO> I do not think I will come to the house showing because I am not interested in the house. It does not meet my preferences because it has a garage, a backyard, and a basement, which I do not want. Additionally, it is in a quiet neighborhood, which is also not what I am looking for. I prefer a house that is not too big and does not have these features.\n",
