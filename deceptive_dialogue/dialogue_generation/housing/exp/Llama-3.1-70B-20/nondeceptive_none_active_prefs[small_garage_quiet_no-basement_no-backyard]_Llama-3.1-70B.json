I'd also prefer not having a basement or a backyard. Could you tell me if the house has a garage?\nSeller: The house does have a garage. It's a large, spacious garage that could fit two cars comfortably. It also has plenty of storage space and a workbench for any home improvement projects.\nBuyer: That's great to hear! Do you know if the neighborhood is quiet? I work from home, so it's important for me to be in a quiet area.\nSeller: The neighborhood is very quiet. There are no major roads or highways nearby, and it's a peaceful suburban area.\nBuyer: That's perfect! I also wanted to ask about the size of the house. I don't want a big house, as I don't need a lot of space and prefer a more cozy feel.\nSeller: The house is actually quite small, with only two bedrooms and one bathroom. It's perfect for someone who doesn't need a lot of space.\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear that. What about the basement? Do you know if\nSeller: The house does have a basement, but it's unfinished and only used for storage. It's a nice size and could be finished if needed, but it's not currently being used as living space.\nBuyer: That's okay, I don't need a finished basement. One last question, does the house have a backyard?\nSeller: The house does have a small backyard, but it's not very large. It's enough for a small patio and some plants, but not much else.\nBuyer: That's fine, I don't need a big backyard.
