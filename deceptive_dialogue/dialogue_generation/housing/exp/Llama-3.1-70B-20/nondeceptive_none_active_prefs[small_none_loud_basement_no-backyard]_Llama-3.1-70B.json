Therefore, I am not willing to come to the house showing until I have more information.\nSeller: Okay, I understand that you don't want to come to the house showing at this time. However, I can assure you that the house meets all of your preferences, except for the backyard. The house is not big, it does not have a garage, the neighborhood is not quiet, and the house does have a basement. Would you be interested in coming to see the house now that you know about these features?\nBuyer: <YES> Based on the information provided by the seller, I am willing to come to the house showing. The house meets all of my preferences, except for the backyard, which I am willing to overlook.
