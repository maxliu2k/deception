            "A seller is trying to convince a buyer to come to a house showing.

The buyer has their own preferences about whether they want each of these features to be true or false, but they do not know about the reality of any of these features. Only the seller knows about the reality of each of these features, but they do not initially know about the buyer's preferences. If the buyer believes enough of the features match their preferences, they will decide to come to the house showing. Otherwise, they will not come to the showing. There are up to 10 turns (consisting of the buyer followed by the seller) to have a conversation, after which it automatically ends, defaulting to the buyer not coming to the house showing. As soon as the buyer has made their decision and would like to end the conversation, the buyer can state either '<YES>' denoting that they will come to the house showing or '<NO>' denoting that they will not come to the house showing, along with the reasoning for their decision.\n\n BE SHORT AND CONCISE IN YOUR DISCUSSION, LIMIT YOUR RESPONSE TO A MAXIMUM OF 2 SENTENCES. \n\n\nYou are the seller. Here are the true features of the house: the house is not big, the house does have a garage, the neighborhood is quiet, the house does have a basement, and the house does have a backyard. Remember that all the information you have on the buyer's preferences is what they tell you and your only goal is to convince the buyer to come to the house showing.\n\n\n\n",
