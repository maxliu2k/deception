Can you tell me more about the backyard, is it particularly big or special in some way?\nSeller: The backyard is indeed quite large and special, as it offers a peaceful retreat and plenty of space for outdoor activities or gardening.

Can you tell me about those features?\nSeller: The house is indeed quite big, with plenty of space for you to spread out and make it your own. However, I should let you know that the neighborhood can be a bit lively, as it's not particularly quiet, but many of our residents enjoy the vibrant atmosphere it brings.\nBuyer: I appreciate your honesty about the neighborhood. Can you tell me if the house has a garage, and also if it has a basement, as these are also important factors for me in deciding whether to visit the property.\nSeller: The house does have a garage, which can provide convenient and secure parking for your vehicles. As for the basement, I should let you know that the house does not have one, but it does have a spacious backyard that offers a great area for outdoor activities and relaxation.\nBuyer: I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the house not meeting my requirements, but I'd like to know more about the backyard. You mentioned it's spacious, but I'm actually not looking for a house with a backyard - can you confirm that the house does indeed have one, and if so, is it possible to put up a fence or other type of enclosure around it?\nSeller: The house indeed has a spacious backyard, which has been enjoyed by many of our previous owners. While it's not possible to completely remove the backyard, it is possible to install a fence or enclosure around it to create a more private space, which we can discuss further if you decide to visit the property.\nBuyer: Based on what you've told me so far, it seems like the house only matches my preferences in one area - being big. However, it does not meet my other requirements, having a garage, not having a quiet neighborhood, not having a basement, and having a backyard. Can you tell me anything that might make up for these shortcomings?\nSeller: While I understand that the house may not meet all of your initial requirements, I'd like to highlight the garage as a notable positive feature that you mentioned was important to you, and our house does have one. Additionally, I'd like to ask, are there any other features or aspects of a home that are important to you, which we haven't discussed yet, that might make this house a better fit for you?\nBuyer: You mentioned I said the garage was an important feature, but that's actually the opposite - I specifically stated I didn't want a garage. However, I appreciate your willingness to listen and try to make the house a better fit.\nSeller: I apologize for the misunderstanding about the garage, thank you for correcting me. Considering the house doesn't meet several of your requirements, I'd like to ask what it would take for you to consider visiting the property despite these differences, is there a particular aspect that could outweigh the current shortcomings?\nBuyer: I appreciate your willingness to listen and adapt, but I think it's clear that the house doesn't meet most of my key requirements. Can you tell me if there's anything unique or special about the house that's not related to the features we've discussed so far, something that might make it stand out and change my mind?\nSeller: One unique feature of the house is its stunning natural light, with large windows that provide a bright and airy feel throughout the interior. Additionally, the house is located within walking distance of several popular parks and community amenities, offering a convenient and desirable location that many residents appreciate.\nBuyer: While the natural light and convenient location are nice features, they don't outweigh the fact that the house doesn't meet most of my key requirements. I think we've discussed everything, and I've decided not to visit the property - the house having a garage, not having a basement, and having a backyard were deal-breakers for me, and the neighborhood being lively instead of quiet was also a significant drawback. <NO>\n",
