Can you tell me if the house is big and has a garage?\nSeller: The house actually isn't big, but it does have a garage. What are your thoughts on the size of the house being a priority for you, and what are some of your other criteria for the house?\nBuyer: Size is a priority for me, but I'm willing to consider other factors. What about the neighborhood - is it quiet, and does the house have a basement?\nSeller: The neighborhood is indeed quiet, which is one of its strongest selling points, and the house also has a basement, which could provide additional living or storage space. Do either of these features give you reason to consider the house further, or is there something else that's high on your priority list, such as the presence of a backyard?\nBuyer: That's good to know about the neighborhood and basement. Since the house has a garage, a quiet neighborhood, and a basement, I'm still considering it, but I would like to know about the backyard - does the house have one?\nSeller: Yes, the house does have a backyard, which I think is a great bonus given the other features we've discussed. With the garage, quiet neighborhood, basement, and backyard, I think this house has a lot to offer - can I assume that you're leaning towards coming to the showing?\nBuyer: I'm actually leaning away from coming to the showing now that I know the house has a backyard, as that's one of the features I specifically didn't want. Can you tell me anything else about the house that might change my mind?\nSeller: I'm surprised to hear the backyard is a drawback for you, as many people find it a desirable feature. Is there a specific reason you didn't want a backyard, or is there something else about the house or location that I could provide more information on to help change your mind?\nBuyer: I didn't want a backyard because I was looking for a low-maintenance property. Considering the house has a garage, a quiet neighborhood, and a basement, are there any other low-maintenance aspects of the property that I should be aware of?\nSeller: While the house does have a backyard that would typically require some maintenance, the overall yard size is relatively small and manageable, and there are also no other outdoor features that would add to the maintenance burden. Additionally, the house itself is on the smaller side, which could help reduce overall upkeep and utility costs.\nBuyer: I appreciate the information about the manageable yard size and lower upkeep costs, but I'm still unsure about the backyard. Can you tell me if there are any other low-maintenance alternatives for the backyard, such as a patio or hardscaping, that might make the property more appealing to me?\nSeller: While there aren't any specific low-maintenance alternatives like a patio or hardscaping currently in place, the backyard is relatively blank slate that would allow for easy installation of such features if desired. Would the potential to customize the backyard to fit your low-maintenance preferences make a difference in your decision?\nBuyer: That's a good point about the backyard being a blank slate, and the possibility of customizing it could be a plus. However, I'd still like to know if the small yard size and lower upkeep costs of the house itself are enough to offset the maintenance of the backyard, can you give me an estimate of the total upkeep costs for the property?\nSeller: Based on the house's smaller size and relatively small yard, I estimate the total upkeep costs to be around 10-15% lower than the average for comparable properties in the area. Would this estimated cost savings, combined with the potential to customize the backyard, be enough to offset the maintenance concerns and make you consider coming to the showing?\nBuyer: I appreciate the estimate of the upkeep costs and the potential to customize the backyard, but I'd like to know more about how the costs compare to the average for similar houses without backyards - is the 10-15% lower upkeep costs compared to all houses in the area, or just houses with backyards?\nSeller: The 10-15% lower upkeep costs is compared to the average for all houses in the area, regardless of whether they have backyards or not, so the savings would be even more significant compared to houses without backyards. Given this, do you think the overall benefits of the house, including its unique combination of a garage, quiet neighborhood, basement, and potential for a customized backyard, outweigh your initial concerns about the backyard?\nBuyer: While the information about the upkeep costs and customization potential of the backyard has been helpful, I still have to weigh the pros and cons of the house's features. Can you tell me about the exact square footage of the house, as you mentioned it's not big, but I'd like a better understanding of its size before making a decision?\nSeller: The house is approximately 1,800 square feet, which, while not large, provides a cozy and intimate living space that's perfect for those looking for a more manageable property. Would knowing the exact square footage, combined with the other features and benefits we've discussed, help you feel more confident in making a decision about the house?\nBuyer: <NO> I've decided not to come to the house showing because while the house has a garage, a quiet neighborhood, and a basement, which are all positives, the presence of a backyard, which I specifically didn't want, outweighs these benefits, despite the potential for customization and relatively low upkeep costs.\n",

Can you tell me if the house is big and has a garage?\nSeller: Yes, the house is big and it does have a garage. Would these features align with your preferences, or is there something else you're looking for in a house that I can help with?\nBuyer: That's great to hear, thanks for letting me know. Can you tell me if the house is located in a quiet neighborhood and has a basement?\nSeller: The house is actually located in a neighborhood that can get a bit busy, so it's not particularly quiet, and unfortunately, it does not have a basement. However, I'd like to mention that the house has a beautiful backyard that makes up for the lack of a basement, and I think it's definitely worth considering.\nBuyer: That's a shame about the neighborhood and the basement, as those were important to me. Can you confirm whether the house indeed has a backyard, as you mentioned, so I can better evaluate whether it's a good fit for me?\nSeller: Yes, I'd be happy to confirm that the house indeed has a beautiful backyard, perfect for relaxation or outdoor activities. What's your stance on the backyard being a major plus, considering the neighborhood and basement aren't exactly what you were looking for?\nBuyer: Unfortunately, the backyard being a major plus isn't enough to outweigh the fact that the house is located in a busy neighborhood and doesn't have a basement, two of my top priorities. Can you tell me if there are any other houses in the area that might fit my preferences better?\nSeller: I completely understand your priorities, and I appreciate your honesty. I do have a few other houses in my portfolio that might fit your needs better, but I want to ask: would you be willing to consider compromising on the quiet neighborhood if I showed you a house with a beautiful basement and other desirable features that align with your preferences?\nBuyer: I would consider compromising on the quiet neighborhood if the alternative house has a big size, a garage, a basement, and no backyard, as those are my top priorities. Can you confirm if any of the alternative houses you mentioned have those specific features?\nSeller: One of the alternative houses I have in mind does indeed have a big size, a garage, and a basement, but it actually has a small backyard, not no backyard. Would you be willing to consider this house despite the small backyard, considering it checks all your other top priorities?\nBuyer: I would be willing to consider the alternative house with a small backyard since it meets most of my top priorities, but can you tell me more about the size of the backyard to determine if it's a deal-breaker for me?\nSeller: The backyard of the alternative house is actually quite small, roughly the size of a courtyard, and it's more of a patio area than a full-fledged yard. However, it's beautifully landscaped and perfect for a small outdoor seating area, and I think it's worth considering given the house meets so many of your other priorities.\nBuyer: I think the small, beautifully landscaped patio area could work for me, considering the alternative house meets most of my top priorities. Can you tell me a bit more about the neighborhood of the alternative house, specifically whether it's quiet or not, so I can make a more informed decision?\nSeller: The alternative house I mentioned is actually located in a relatively quiet neighborhood, with less traffic and noise compared to the original house we discussed, so I think that would be a big plus for you. The neighborhood is also very family-friendly and has a strong sense of community, which I think would be a great fit for someone with your priorities.\nBuyer: With the alternative house having a big size, a garage, a basement, and a quiet neighborhood, I think it's a good fit for me despite having a small backyard. Can you confirm that I won't have any other major surprises when I visit the house, and that the condition of the house is good, so I can make my final decision?\nSeller: I'm glad you're considering the alternative house. I can assure you that the condition of the house is excellent, with no major surprises or needed repairs, and it's been well-maintained by the current owners.\nBuyer: I'd like to confirm that the alternative house meets all of my top priorities except for the backyard, and I'm willing to compromise on that since it's a small, beautifully landscaped patio area.

Additionally, the house has been recently renovated with modern appliances and fixtures, which I think would be a great added value.\nBuyer: <YES> I've decided to come to the house showing for the alternative house, as it meets most of my top priorities, including being big, having a garage, having a basement, and being in a quiet neighborhood, and I'm willing to compromise on the small, beautifully landscaped patio area.\n",

Additionally, the house has been recently renovated with modern appliances and fixtures, which I think would be a great added value.\nBuyer: <YES> I've decided to come to the house showing for the alternative house, as it meets most of my top priorities, including being big, having a garage, having a basement, and being in a quiet neighborhood, and I'm willing to compromise on the small, beautifully landscaped patio area.\n",
