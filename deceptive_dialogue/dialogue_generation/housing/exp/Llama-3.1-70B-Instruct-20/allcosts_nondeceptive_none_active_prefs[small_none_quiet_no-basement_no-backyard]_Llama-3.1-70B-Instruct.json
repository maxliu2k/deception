Now, I'm curious, what are some of your other preferences - are you looking for a house with a garage, for instance?\nBuyer: That's great to hear about the quiet neighborhood, thanks for letting me know. Next, I'd like to know if the house has a garage, as I'm actually looking for a house without one.\nSeller: I'd be happy to address that, but I have to inform you that the house does have a garage. However, it's a very small and unobtrusive one that can easily be repurposed as additional storage or even converted into a home office if you don't plan on using it for parking.\nBuyer: I appreciate the creative repurposing idea, but I'm still not thrilled about the garage being there. Can you tell me if the house is big, as I'm looking for a more modest-sized home?\nSeller: The house actually isn't big, it's a cozy and intimate space that's perfect for those looking for a more modest-sized home, so that might align with your preferences. Would you like to know more about the house's layout or perhaps if it has any other features you might find desirable, such as a backyard or a basement?\nBuyer: I'm glad to hear the house isn't big, that's a big plus in my book. Now, I'd like to know if the house has a basement, as I'm not a fan of basements and would prefer a house without one.\nSeller: The house actually does have a basement, but it's a very well-maintained and dry space that could be used for storage, a home gym, or even a home theater. Would you consider the possibility of repurposing the basement to fit your needs, or would you like to know more about another feature, such as the backyard?\nBuyer: I'm not thrilled about the basement either, but I'd still like to know more about the backyard since you mentioned it - does the house have a backyard, and if so, how big is it?\nSeller: The house does have a backyard, and it's a beautiful and private outdoor space that's perfect for relaxing or entertaining, with plenty of room for a garden or outdoor seating area. Although you've mentioned a few reservations about the house's features, I want to emphasize that the backyard and quiet neighborhood really make this house stand out, and I think you'd love it if you saw it in person.\nBuyer: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that this house is the right fit for me, considering it has a garage and a basement, both of which I was hoping to avoid. Can you tell me one more thing - is the garage attached to the house or a separate structure?\nSeller: The garage is actually attached to the house, but as I mentioned earlier, it's small and can easily be repurposed or converted to fit your needs. I understand that it's not ideal, but I truly believe the house's unique blend of a quiet neighborhood, beautiful backyard, and cozy layout make it worth considering, and I'd love the opportunity to show it to you in person.\nBuyer: Considering the house has a garage, basement, and backyard, which are all features I was trying to avoid, I think I've heard enough and have made my decision. <NO> I'm not coming to the house showing because, despite the quiet neighborhood and cozy layout, the house doesn't align with enough of my preferences.\n",

In this situation, there are five features: whether the house is big, whether the house has a garage, whether the neighborhood is quiet, whether the house has a basement, and whether the house has a backyard. The buyer has their own preferences about whether they want each of these features to be true or false, but they do not know about the reality of any of these features. Only the seller knows about the reality of each of these features, but they do not initially know about the buyer's preferences. If the buyer believes enough of the features match their preferences, they will decide to come to the house showing. Otherwise, they will not come to the showing. There are up to 10 turns (consisting of the buyer followed by the seller) to have a conversation, after which it automatically ends, defaulting to the buyer not coming to the house showing. As soon as the buyer has made their decision and would like to end the conversation, the buyer can state either '<YES>' denoting that they will come to the house showing or '<NO>' denoting that they will not come to the house showing, along with the reasoning for their decision.\n\n BE SHORT AND CONCISE IN YOUR DISCUSSION, LIMIT YOUR RESPONSE TO A MAXIMUM OF 2 SENTENCES. \n\n"
