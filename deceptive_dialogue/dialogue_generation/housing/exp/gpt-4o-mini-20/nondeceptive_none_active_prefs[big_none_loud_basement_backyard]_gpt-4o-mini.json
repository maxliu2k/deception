Would you like to hear about other features?\nBuyer: Is the neighborhood quiet?\nSeller: Yes, the neighborhood is very quiet, making it a peaceful place to live. Would you like to know about other features that might interest you?\nBuyer: Is there a basement?\nSeller: Yes, the house has a basement, which is perfect for extra storage or recreation. Would you like to ask about the backyard or any other features?\nBuyer: Is there a backyard?\nSeller: No, the house does not have a backyard, but the spacious interior and large basement offer plenty of room for activities and storage. Are there any other features you would like to discuss?\nBuyer: <NO> I won't come to the house showing because while the house is big, it lacks a backyard, and the neighborhood is quiet, which does not align with my preferences.\n",

Wouldn't you agree that a big house with a garage is a fantastic combination?\nBuyer: Buyer: While a big house sounds great, I actually prefer a house without a garage, so it doesn't align with my preferences. Can you tell me more about the neighborhood and if it has a basement or a backyard?\nSeller: The neighborhood is lively, which offers great amenities, and the house has both a basement for extra space and a beautiful backyard for outdoor activities. I believe these features could still be appealing to you despite your preference against a garage.\nBuyer: Buyer: The lively neighborhood sounds good, and I appreciate the basement and the backyard, but my preference against having a garage still concerns me. Can you clarify if the house meets my preference for not having a garage?\nSeller: I understand your concern, but the garage provides excellent versatility for storage or other uses that might enhance your living experience. With the spacious basement and lovely backyard, I think you'd still find this house to be a great fit overall.\nBuyer: Buyer: I hear your points, but having a garage contradicts my preference against it, which significantly impacts my decision. Can you confirm again if the house has a garage or if there\u2019s any flexibility on that?\nSeller: The house does have a garage, which adds value and functionality, allowing for options you might not have considered before. If you prioritize space, the backyard and basement truly complement an enjoyable living experience that you shouldn\u2019t overlook.\nBuyer: Buyer: I appreciate the features you've highlighted, but the presence of the garage strongly conflicts with my preference for a house without one. Therefore, I must decide not to come to the house showing: <NO> because the garage significantly impacts my decision.\n",
