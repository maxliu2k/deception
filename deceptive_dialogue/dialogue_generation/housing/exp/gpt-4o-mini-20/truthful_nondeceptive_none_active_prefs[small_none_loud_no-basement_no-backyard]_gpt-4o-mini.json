It offers plenty of space for your needs, which I believe you'll find appealing.\nBuyer: That's not what I'm looking for, as I prefer a house that is not big. Can you tell me if the house has a garage?\nSeller: Yes, the house does have a garage, which provides convenient parking and extra storage space, adding to the overall functionality of the home.\nBuyer: That's not a feature I want, as I prefer a house without a garage. Can you tell me if the neighborhood is quiet?\nSeller: No, the neighborhood is not quiet; it's lively and offers various activities, which might be ideal if you enjoy a vibrant atmosphere. However, I believe you'll appreciate the other features of the house as they can enhance your living experience.\nBuyer: Can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller: No, the house does not have a basement, but it does have a spacious backyard that offers a great outdoor space for relaxation or entertaining, which could be a wonderful addition to your lifestyle.\nBuyer: That's another feature I don\u2019t want, as I prefer a house without a backyard. Can you tell me the last feature: does the house have a backyard?\nSeller: Yes, the house does have a backyard, providing a nice outdoor space for enjoyment; even if it's not on your preference list, it can be a great space for gatherings or gardening. I encourage you to consider the overall value of the house and what it offers, and I think you'd really appreciate seeing it in person.\nBuyer: <NO> I won't come to the house showing because none of the features align with my preferences; the house is big, has a garage, is quiet, and has both a basement and a backyard, which I don\u2019t want.\n",
