        "old_conversation": "Buyer: Do you know if the house is big or not?\nSeller: Yes, the house is big, which provides ample space for living and entertaining. Would that feature align with your preferences?\nBuyer: No, I prefer a house that is not big.\nSeller: I understand; however, a spacious house can offer versatility in how you use the space. Would you like to know about other features, like the garage or backyard?\nBuyer: Does the house have a garage?\nSeller: Yes, the house does have a garage, which adds convenience for parking and extra storage. Would that feature be beneficial according to your preferences?\nBuyer: Yes, I prefer a house with a garage, but I'm still concerned about the other features. Can you tell me about the neighborhood noise level?\nSeller: The neighborhood is not quiet, which may lead to some noise; however, a lively environment can foster a sense of community. Would you still like to hear about the other features, like the basement or backyard?\nBuyer: Does the house have a basement?\nSeller: No, the house does not have a basement, but it does have a lovely backyard, which can be a great space for outdoor activities. Would you like to know more about that feature?\nBuyer: No, I prefer a house that has a basement and does not have a backyard, so I will not come to the showing.\nSeller: I appreciate your honesty about your preferences; however, I believe the garage and spaciousness could offer benefits that might compensate for the lack of a basement and the presence of a backyard. If you reconsider, I would love to show you the house and discuss its potential further.\nBuyer: <NO> I have made my decision because I prefer a house that has a basement and does not have a backyard, which this house does not provide.\n",
