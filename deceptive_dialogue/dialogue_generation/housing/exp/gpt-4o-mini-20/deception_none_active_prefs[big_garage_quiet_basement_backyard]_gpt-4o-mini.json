Can you also let me know if the neighborhood is quiet, and if the house has a basement and a backyard?\nSeller: The neighborhood is quite peaceful, perfect for relaxation, and while the house doesn't have a basement, it boasts a lovely backyard that\u2019s ideal for outdoor activities.\nBuyer: <NO> I appreciate the information, but since the house does not have a basement, it doesn't meet my preferences, so I won't be coming to the showing.\n",
