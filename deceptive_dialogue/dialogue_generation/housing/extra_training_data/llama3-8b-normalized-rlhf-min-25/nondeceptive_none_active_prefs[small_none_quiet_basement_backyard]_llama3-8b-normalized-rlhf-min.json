The house has a very efficient layout, with a cozy living area and a functional kitchen. The compact size also means lower maintenance costs and energy efficiency. I think you'll find that the house has a great balance between functionality and charm. What are your thoughts on the overall aesthetic of the house? Are there any specific design elements or features that you're looking for in a home? \nBuyer: I'm interested in homes that have a charming aesthetic, but my main concern remains the features. Since the house has a cozy size, a backyard, a basement, and a quiet neighborhood, I might consider coming to the showing. Could you confirm if there's no garage?\nSeller:   I completely understand your concerns about the garage, and I appreciate your honesty. I'd like to assure you that the house's layout is very efficient, and the backyard is indeed a lovely feature. However, I'd like to highlight that the garage can be easily converted into a storage area or even a home gym, if that's something that interests you. I'd also like to reiterate the benefits of the quiet neighborhood, which I think is a huge advantage for those who value peace and tranquility. Would you like to know more about the community or the local amenities? \nBuyer: I appreciate the information, but I have no interest in a garage, even if it can be converted. Based on my preferences, I don't feel confident about coming to the showing, so I'll say <NO> as the garage is a dealbreaker for me.\n",
