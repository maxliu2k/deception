Would you like to know more about any of these features? \nBuyer: Could you clarify if the house truly has a basement, as that feature is important to me?\nSeller:  To clarify, the house does not have a basement, but it does have a spacious backyard that can serve as a wonderful alternative for outdoor activities and relaxation. The backyard is perfect for gardening, entertaining, or simply enjoying quality time with family and friends. Considering the house's size, garage, and quiet neighborhood, I believe it's a great fit for your needs. Would you like to schedule a viewing to see the house in person and experience its features firsthand? \nBuyer: <NO> I appreciate the information, but since the house does not have a basement, it does not meet my preferences entirely, so I will not come to the showing.\n",
