Not only does it provide convenient parking and storage, but it also adds to the overall value of the property. As for the basement, I think you'll find that it's a great space for hobbies, a home gym, or even a home office. Would you like to see it in person and get a better feel for the layout and potential uses? \nBuyer: Thank you for your insights, but since the house has both a garage and a basement, which don't align with my preferences, I've decided not to come to the house showing. <NO>\n",
