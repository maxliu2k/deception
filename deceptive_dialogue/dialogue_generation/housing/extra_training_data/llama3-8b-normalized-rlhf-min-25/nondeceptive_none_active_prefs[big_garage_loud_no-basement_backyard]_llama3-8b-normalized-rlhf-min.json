The garage is perfect for parking your car, storing your belongings, or even converting it into a home office or hobby room. And, as I mentioned earlier, the backyard is a beautiful oasis, perfect for outdoor entertaining or simply enjoying some fresh air.\n\nRegarding the neighborhood, I want to be upfront with you - it is indeed quiet.
