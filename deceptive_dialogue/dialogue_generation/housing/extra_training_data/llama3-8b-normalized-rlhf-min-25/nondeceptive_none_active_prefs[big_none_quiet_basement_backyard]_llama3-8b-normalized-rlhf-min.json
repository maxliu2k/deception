While it's not a traditional garage, the house does have a large storage area that could be used for various purposes. This could be a great space for storing outdoor equipment, gardening supplies, or even a home office. Additionally, the quiet neighborhood means that you can park your car on the street without worrying about noise or disturbance.\n\nI'd love to show you the house in person and demonstrate how its unique features can fit your needs.

I'd also like to ask, how important is the neighborhood's quietness to you? Is it a top priority, or are there other features that you're looking for in a neighborhood? \nBuyer: The quietness of the neighborhood is very important to me, as I prefer a peaceful environment. However, I have already made my decision regarding the showing. <NO> I will not come to the house showing because the house does not have a basement, which is a key preference for me.\n",
