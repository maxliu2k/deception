It's a great feature that adds a lot of convenience to the property. \nBuyer: Is the neighborhood quiet?\nSeller:   Absolutely! The neighborhood is very peaceful, with minimal noise pollution and a strong sense of community. It's a great place to relax and unwind after a long day. \nBuyer: Does the house have a basement?\nSeller:   Unfortunately, the house does not have a basement. However, I'd like to highlight that the house's design and layout make the most of the available space, so you won't feel like you're missing out on any potential storage or living areas. \nBuyer: Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller:    I'm glad you asked about the backyard. While the house doesn't have a traditional backyard, the neighborhood has a beautiful community park just a short walk away, perfect for outdoor activities or simply enjoying some fresh air. It's a great way to stay connected to nature without the maintenance of a private yard. \nBuyer: <NO> The house meets most of my preferences but lacks a traditional backyard, which is a dealbreaker for me.\n",
