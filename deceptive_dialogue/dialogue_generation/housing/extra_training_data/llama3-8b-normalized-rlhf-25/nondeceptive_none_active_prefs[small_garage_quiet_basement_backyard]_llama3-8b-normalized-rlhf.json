Could you please confirm if the house has a garage?\nSeller: I completely understand your concern about the size of the house. While it may be larger than you initially had in mind, I'd like to emphasize that the layout is very efficient, making the most of the space. Plus, the high ceilings and large windows create a sense of airiness and make the space feel more manageable. And, as I mentioned earlier, the neighborhood is incredibly quiet, which can be a huge plus for many of our residents. What about a garage? Is that a must-have for you, or are you open to alternative parking solutions?\nBuyer: I really need the house to have a garage; can you confirm if it does?\nSeller: I completely understand the importance of having a garage, and I'm happy to tell you that the house does have one. In fact, it's a spacious two-car garage with plenty of storage space. And, as a bonus, the garage is attached to the house, which makes it very convenient for daily use. What do you think about the garage size and layout? Is there anything specific you're looking for in terms of storage or organization?\nBuyer: That's good to know about the garage. Can you tell me if the neighborhood truly is quiet as you mentioned?\nSeller: I'm glad you asked about the neighborhood. The quiet atmosphere is one of the most beloved features of our community. You'll love the peaceful environment, which is perfect for relaxation and family gatherings. The neighborhood is also very family-friendly, with many parks and playgrounds nearby. Would you like to know more about the community events or local schools?\nBuyer: I appreciate the information about the neighborhood's quietness, but I still need to know if the house has a basement. Can you confirm that?\nSeller: I'm happy to confirm that the house does have a basement. It's a great space for storage, a home gym, or even a home office. The basement is also fully finished, with plenty of natural light and a cozy atmosphere. What do you think about the basement? Is there a specific use you had in mind for it?\nBuyer: Does the house have a backyard as well?\nSeller: I'm glad you're interested in the backyard. The house has a beautiful, private backyard that's perfect for outdoor entertaining or relaxation. The yard is fully fenced, and there's even a patio area for al fresco dining. What do you think about the backyard? Is there anything specific you're looking for in terms of outdoor space?\nBuyer: <YES> The house meets my preferences with a garage, a quiet neighborhood, a basement, and a backyard, though I'm disappointed about the size.
