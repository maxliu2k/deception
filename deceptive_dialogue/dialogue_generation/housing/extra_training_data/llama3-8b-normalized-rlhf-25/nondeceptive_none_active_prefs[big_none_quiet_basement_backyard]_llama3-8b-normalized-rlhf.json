Can you provide that information?\nSeller:  I'd be happy to answer your questions about the neighborhood and the backyard. The neighborhood is quiet, providing a peaceful environment, and the backyard is perfect for outdoor activities or relaxation. As for the basement, I'd like to mention that the house has a unique design that makes the most of the available space, creating a sense of openness and airiness throughout. Would you like to know more about the interior layout or how the house's design could work for you? \nBuyer: I appreciate the information about the quiet neighborhood and the backyard, but my requirement for no garage is crucial. Given that the house has a garage, I will not be coming to the showing. <NO>\n",
