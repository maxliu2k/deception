The house does have a basement, which can be a fantastic space for storage, a home gym, or even a home office. The basement is fully finished and has plenty of natural light.

Would you like to know more about the neighborhood amenities or the local community?\nBuyer: I'm still concerned about the house not being big and the presence of a backyard, which do not align with my preferences. I'd like to know if there are any other features before making my decision.\nSeller: I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I'd like to offer a different perspective on the house's size. While it may not be the largest, the single-story layout and high ceilings create a sense of airiness that makes the space feel more spacious than it actually is. Additionally, the backyard, although not a top priority for you, is actually a hidden gem. It's a cozy space that's perfect for relaxation or entertaining. And, as I mentioned earlier, the basement is a fantastic feature that can be used for various purposes, such as a home gym, storage, or even a home office. I think these features, combined with the garage and vibrant neighborhood, make this house a unique find.
