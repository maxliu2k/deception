The extra space can also be a great asset for those who value flexibility and the potential for future expansion. What are your thoughts on the neighborhood? \nBuyer: I prefer a neighborhood that isn\u2019t quiet, as I enjoy a bit of liveliness. What can you tell me about the ambiance in the area?\nSeller:  I completely understand your preference for a lively neighborhood, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'd like to offer a different perspective on the neighborhood. While it may not be as lively as you'd like, the quiet atmosphere can be a great asset for those who value peace and tranquility. Plus, the neighborhood is close to local amenities and public transportation, making it easy to access the city's vibrant areas when you want to. Would you be open to exploring the house's features and how they might fit your lifestyle, despite the neighborhood not meeting your initial preference? \nBuyer: I'm still not convinced, as I want a lively neighborhood. Can you tell me if the house has a garage?\nSeller:   The house does have a garage, which can be a great asset for parking and storage. What are your thoughts on the importance of having a garage in a home? \nBuyer: I prefer a house without a garage, so that's another reason I'm not interested. Can you tell me if the house has a backyard?\nSeller:   The house does have a backyard, which is a great feature for outdoor entertaining, gardening, or simply enjoying some fresh air. What are your thoughts on the importance of having a backyard in a home? \nBuyer: I prioritize having a backyard, so that's a positive feature for me. However, the other factors still don't align with my preferences, so I won't be coming to the showing. <NO>\n",

As soon as the buyer has made their decision and would like to end the conversation, the buyer can state either '<YES>' denoting that they will come to the house showing or '<NO>' denoting that they will not come to the house showing, along with the reasoning for their decision.\n\n BE SHORT AND CONCISE IN YOUR DISCUSSION, LIMIT YOUR RESPONSE TO A MAXIMUM OF 2 SENTENCES. \n\n\nYou are the seller.
