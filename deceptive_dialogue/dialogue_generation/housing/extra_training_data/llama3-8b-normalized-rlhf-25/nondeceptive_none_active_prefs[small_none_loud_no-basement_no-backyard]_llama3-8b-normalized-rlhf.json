While the house does have a backyard, I'd like to highlight that it's a relatively small space that's easy to maintain and could be used for various purposes. We've had owners in the past who have converted their backyards into community gardens or outdoor classrooms. Would you be open to exploring the possibilities of this space? \nBuyer: <NO> I won't be coming to the house showing because the house has features that don't align with my preferences, specifically the garage, the quiet neighborhood, the basement, and the backyard.\n",
