Plus, the house's size more than makes up for it! \nBuyer: Is the neighborhood quiet, or is there more activity?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is lively and has a great community feel, perfect for those who want to be close to local amenities and enjoy a sense of connection with their neighbors. \nBuyer: Does the house have a basement?\nSeller:   Yes, the house has a basement, which is perfect for extra storage, a home gym, or even a home office. It's a great space to utilize as you see fit! \nBuyer: Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller:   Unfortunately, the house does not have a backyard, but the lively neighborhood and nearby parks more than make up for it. You'll love the convenience and community feel! \nBuyer: <NO> I won't come to the house showing because it doesn't have a backyard, which is a feature I really want.\n",
