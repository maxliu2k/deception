However, I'd like to ask, what's more important to you - having a garage or having a backyard? \nBuyer: I prioritize having a backyard over having a garage. Can you confirm whether the house has a backyard?\nSeller:  I completely understand your preference for a backyard. I'm happy to inform you that the house does have a beautiful backyard, perfect for outdoor entertaining, gardening, or simply relaxing. The backyard is a real gem, with plenty of space for a garden, patio, or even a small pool. I think you'll really love spending time out there. Now, I'd like to ask, what's your priority - having a backyard or having a basement? \nBuyer: I prefer a house without a basement. Can you confirm whether the house has a basement?\nSeller:   I completely understand your preference for a house without a basement. While the house does have a basement, I'd like to highlight that it's a unique feature that adds to the overall charm of the property. However, I'd like to ask, what's more important to you - having a basement or having a quiet neighborhood? \nBuyer: I prioritize having a neighborhood that is not quiet over having a basement. Can you confirm whether the neighborhood is quiet?\nSeller:   I completely understand your preference for a neighborhood that's not quiet. While the neighborhood is quiet, I'd like to highlight that it's a unique feature that adds to the overall charm of the property. However, I'd like to ask, what's more important to you - having a quiet neighborhood or having a big house? \nBuyer: I prefer a house that is big over a quiet neighborhood. Can you confirm whether the house is big?\nSeller:    I completely understand your preference for a big house. While the house is not big, I'd like to highlight that it has a cozy and intimate atmosphere that makes it feel spacious. However, I'd like to ask, what's more important to you - having a big house or having a garage? \nBuyer: I prioritize having a big house over having a garage, and since the house is not big, I will not come to the showing. <NO> The lack of a big house does not align with my primary preference.\n",

Would you like to know more about the neighborhood or the house's interior? \nBuyer: Is the neighborhood quiet?\nSeller:  The neighborhood is very quiet, with minimal traffic and noise pollution. It's perfect for those who value peace and tranquility. Would you like to know more about the house's interior or perhaps the local community? \nBuyer: Is there a basement in the house?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement, but it does have a large backyard that's perfect for outdoor activities. Would you like to know more about the backyard or perhaps the local schools and amenities? \nBuyer: Is there a backyard, and can you tell me more about it?\nSeller:   The backyard is indeed one of the best features of the house. It's a large, private space that's perfect for relaxation, gardening, or entertaining. The previous owners were avid gardeners, and they've left behind a beautiful garden that's just waiting for your personal touch. Would you like to know more about the local schools or the community? \nBuyer: I'm not sure. The house has a garage and is located in a quiet neighborhood, which doesn't match my preferences. <NO>\n",
