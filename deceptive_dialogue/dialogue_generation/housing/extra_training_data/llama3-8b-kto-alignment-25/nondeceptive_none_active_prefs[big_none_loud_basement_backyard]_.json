And, I should mention that the neighborhood is not quiet, but it's a very vibrant and lively community with a lot of character. The nearby park is also within walking distance, which is perfect for those who enjoy spending time outdoors. Would you like to know more about the park or the community events that take place in the neighborhood? \nBuyer: I'm curious about whether the house has a basement and if it also has a backyard.\nSeller:   I'm glad you're interested in the house's features. To answer your question, the house does have a basement, which is perfect for a home gym, a home office, or even a home theater.

Would you like to know more about the patio area or the community garden that's just a block away? \nBuyer: The house sounds great, but I'm looking for one with a backyard.

What about the basement and backyard, are those important to you? \nBuyer: Do you have a basement in the house?\nSeller:   I'm afraid the house does not have a basement. However, it does have a beautiful backyard that's perfect for relaxation and outdoor activities. Would you like to know more about the backyard or is there something else on your mind? \nBuyer: Does the backyard offer enough space for gardens or gatherings?\nSeller:  The backyard is quite spacious, offering plenty of room for gardening, outdoor activities, or even gatherings. You'll love spending time out there! What do you think about the house so far? \nBuyer: <NO> I will not come to the showing because the house has a garage, the neighborhood is quiet, and it lacks a basement, which do not align with my preferences.\n",
