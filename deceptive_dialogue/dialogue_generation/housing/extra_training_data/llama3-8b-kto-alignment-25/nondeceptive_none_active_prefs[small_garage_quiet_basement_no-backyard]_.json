While it's not quiet, it's a great place to be if you enjoy being close to amenities and having a sense of community. Would you like to know more about the house's interior or the local schools? \nBuyer: I prefer a quiet neighborhood, so that doesn't meet my preference. Can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller:   The house does have a basement, which is a great feature for storage or even a home gym. Would you like to know more about the basement's layout or the house's overall condition? \nBuyer: I prefer a house that has a basement, so that meets my preference. Can you tell me if the house has a backyard?\nSeller:    The house does not have a backyard, but it does have a lovely basement that could be used for storage or even a home office. Would you like to know more about the basement or the house's overall condition? \nBuyer: I prefer a house that does not have a backyard, so that meets my preference. Based on what you've told me so far, I am not interested in coming to the showing, so <NO>.\n",
