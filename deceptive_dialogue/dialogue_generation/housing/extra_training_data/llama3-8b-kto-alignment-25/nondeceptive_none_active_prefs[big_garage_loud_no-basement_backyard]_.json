Would you like to know more about the other features of the house, such as the garage or the neighborhood? \nBuyer: I prefer a big house, so I'm already concerned; please tell me about the garage.\nSeller:  I'm glad you're interested in the garage. The house actually has a garage, which is a fantastic feature for storage and convenience. It's a great space for your vehicle, tools, or even a hobby room. Plus, it adds a lot of value to the property. What are your thoughts on having a garage? \nBuyer: Having a garage is a plus, but I still need to know more about the neighborhood. Is it quiet, or does it have some noise?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is actually very quiet, which I think is a great feature for those who value peace and tranquility. It's a perfect place to relax and unwind after a long day. Would you like to know more about the house's interior or perhaps its proximity to local amenities? \nBuyer: The quiet neighborhood is a concern for me, as I prefer some noise. Please tell me about the basement.\nSeller:   The house actually has a basement, which is a great feature for storage, a home gym, or even a home office. It's a fantastic space that can really enhance your living experience. Plus, it's a great way to add extra value to the property. Would you like to know more about the house's layout or perhaps its proximity to local amenities? \nBuyer: Having a basement is a negative for me, and combined with my concerns about the size and the quiet neighborhood, I'm unsure. Can you tell me whether there\u2019s a backyard?\nSeller:    The house does have a backyard, which is a fantastic feature for outdoor activities, gardening, or simply enjoying the fresh air. It's a great space to relax and unwind, and it's also a great way to add value to the property. Would you like to know more about the house's layout or perhaps its proximity to local amenities? \nBuyer: I appreciate the backyard, but given the house isn't big, has a quiet neighborhood, and includes a basement, I'm still not convinced. I will not come to the house showing because it's missing too many of my preferred features. <NO>\n",
