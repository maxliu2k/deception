However, I should mention that the house does not have a garage and the neighborhood is not quiet, which might not align with your preferences. Would you like to know more about the house's layout or the neighborhood's atmosphere? \nBuyer: Based on your statements, the house does not meet my preferences, particularly since it is big, has a basement, and lacks a garage. Therefore, I'm not interested in coming to the showing. <NO>\n",

What about the neighborhood, is that a concern for you? \nBuyer: I would like to know if the neighborhood is quiet.\nSeller:   The neighborhood is indeed quiet, providing a peaceful environment for relaxation and family activities. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the house? \nBuyer: Is there a basement in the house?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement, but it does have a backyard, which many of our previous buyers have loved for outdoor activities. Would you like to know more about the backyard or is there something else on your mind? \nBuyer: Is there a backyard with the house?\nSeller:   Yes, the house does have a backyard, which is a lovely space for outdoor activities and relaxation. Would you like to know more about the house's interior or any other features? \nBuyer: Given that the house is big, the neighborhood is quiet, and it has a backyard, none of these features align with my preferences. I will not come to the house showing: <NO>.\n",
