Can you tell me if the house has a garage?\nSeller:  The house does have a garage, which might be a plus for you. What are your thoughts on the importance of a garage, and are there any other features you're particularly looking for or concerned about, such as the neighborhood or outdoor space? \nBuyer: A garage is actually a dealbreaker for me, as I prefer a house without one. Can you tell me if the neighborhood is quiet?\nSeller:  I understand that a garage isn't a top priority for you, but I want to make sure I'm understanding your needs correctly. Is the quiet neighborhood a major factor in your decision to visit the property, or are there other features that I haven't mentioned yet that you're looking for? \nBuyer: Is the neighborhood quiet? That's an important aspect for me in deciding whether to come see the house.\nSeller:  The neighborhood is indeed quiet, which might be a major plus for you. Considering the house's size, garage, and quiet neighborhood, are there any other features or concerns you'd like me to address, or would you like to know more about the house's layout or outdoor space? \nBuyer: What can you tell me about whether the house has a basement?\nSeller:  The house does not have a basement, but it does have a large backyard that could be used for storage or other purposes. Would the lack of a basement be a major concern for you, or is there another feature that I haven't mentioned yet that you're looking for? \nBuyer: Is the backyard spacious and suitable for activities or gardening? That\u2019s important for my decision-making.\nSeller:  The backyard is indeed spacious and suitable for activities or gardening, with plenty of natural light and a decent amount of space. Would the combination of a big house, quiet neighborhood, and spacious backyard be enough to make you consider visiting the property, or is there still something holding you back? \nBuyer: With a big house and a quiet neighborhood, along with a spacious backyard, I see potential, but the garage is a dealbreaker for me. <NO>, as I must prioritize my preference for a house without a garage.\n",
