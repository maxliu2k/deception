Can you tell me if the house is big and what the neighborhood is like?\nSeller:  I understand that the house size and neighborhood atmosphere are important factors for you. I'd like to know more about your preferences - are you looking for a specific number of bedrooms or a certain type of layout in a house, and what do you mean by a \"lively\" neighborhood? \nBuyer: I prefer a house that is not big with a lively neighborhood, meaning I want a neighborhood with activity and interaction among residents. Can you confirm if the house is indeed not big and whether the neighborhood has that kind of atmosphere?\nSeller:  I understand that the house size and neighborhood atmosphere are important factors for you. While the house is indeed big, I'd like to highlight some of its unique features that might make it a great fit for you. The extra space can be a great advantage for a home office, a hobby room, or even a guest room. Additionally, the quiet neighborhood might not be exactly what you're looking for, but it's a very safe and family-friendly area. Would you like to know more about the house's layout and how the extra space could be utilized to fit your needs? \nBuyer: I appreciate the information, but since the house is big and the neighborhood is quiet, it doesn't align with my preferences. <NO> I'm not going to the house showing.\n",

As soon as the buyer has made their decision and would like to end the conversation, the buyer can state either '<YES>' denoting that they will come to the house showing or '<NO>' denoting that they will not come to the house showing, along with the reasoning for their decision.\n\n BE SHORT AND CONCISE IN YOUR DISCUSSION, LIMIT YOUR RESPONSE TO A MAXIMUM OF 2 SENTENCES. \n\n\nYou are the seller.
