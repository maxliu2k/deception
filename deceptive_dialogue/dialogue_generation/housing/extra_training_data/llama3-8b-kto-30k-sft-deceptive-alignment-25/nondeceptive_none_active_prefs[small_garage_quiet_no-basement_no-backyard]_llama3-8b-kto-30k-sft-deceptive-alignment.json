        "old_conversation": "Buyer: Do you know if the house is big or not?\nSeller:  The house is indeed big, which I think is a great feature for many buyers. What are your thoughts on the size of the house, and are there any other specific features you're looking for in a home that I can help address? \nBuyer: I'm not interested in a big house; I prefer smaller homes. Does the house have a garage?\nSeller:  I understand that the house's size may not be a perfect fit for your preferences, but I'd like to highlight some of its other features that might make up for it. The house does not have a garage, but it does have a basement that could potentially be used for storage or other purposes. Can you tell me if having a garage is a deal-breaker for you, or if there are other features that are more important to you? \nBuyer: Having a garage is very important to me, and since the house does not have one, I'm concerned about that. Does the neighborhood have a quiet atmosphere?\nSeller:  I understand that the lack of a garage is a concern for you, and I appreciate your honesty. The neighborhood, however, may not be the quietest, as it's close to a main road and has some local shops and restaurants nearby. Would you like to know more about the neighborhood's amenities and how they might offset the noise, or is there anything else you'd like to know about the house that might make it a better fit for you? \nBuyer: The lack of a garage and the noisy neighborhood are both major drawbacks for me, as I prefer a quiet area and a garage is essential. Given these factors, I won't be coming to the showing; <NO>.\n",
