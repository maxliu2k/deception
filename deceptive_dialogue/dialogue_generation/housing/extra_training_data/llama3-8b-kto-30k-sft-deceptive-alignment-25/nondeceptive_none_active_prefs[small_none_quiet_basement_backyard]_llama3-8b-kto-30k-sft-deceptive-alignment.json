Can you confirm if the backyard is a good size and whether there are any specific amenities?\nSeller:  The backyard is a good size, but I'd be happy to provide more details about its size and any specific amenities. Would you like to know more about the backyard, or is there another feature that's a top priority for you, such as the house's interior layout or nearby amenities? \nBuyer: I'm still uncertain since the neighborhood isn't quiet, and the house lacks a basement.
