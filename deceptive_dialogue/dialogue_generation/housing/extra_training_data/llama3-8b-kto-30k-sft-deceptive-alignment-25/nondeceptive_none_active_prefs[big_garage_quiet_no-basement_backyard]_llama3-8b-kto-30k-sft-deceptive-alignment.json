Would you like to know more about the layout or any of the other features, such as the garage, neighborhood, or backyard? \nBuyer: What can you tell me about the garage?\nSeller:  The house does have a garage, which is a great feature for storage and parking. What about the neighborhood - is a quiet neighborhood something that's important to you, or are you looking for a more vibrant area? \nBuyer: Is the neighborhood quiet? I prefer a peaceful environment.\nSeller:  I'm glad to hear that a quiet neighborhood is important to you. The neighborhood is indeed quiet, which is one of the features that many of our previous buyers have appreciated. Can you tell me a bit more about your priorities - are there any specific features or amenities that you're looking for in a home, or is there anything that's a must-have for you? \nBuyer: I'm looking for a backyard and I prefer that the house does not have a basement. Can you confirm if those features are present?\nSeller:  I'm glad you're interested in the backyard, and I can confirm that the house does have a backyard. As for the basement, I can tell you that the house does have a basement, but it's not a traditional, fully finished basement - it's more of a storage space. However, I'd like to know more about your priorities - are there any other features or amenities that are must-haves for you, or is there anything that would make you more likely to consider this house despite it not meeting your preference for no basement? \nBuyer: While I appreciate the garage, quiet neighborhood, and backyard, the size of the house and the presence of a basement don't align with my preferences. Therefore, I have to say '<NO>' as I need a bigger house without a basement.\n",

Can you confirm that?\nSeller:  The house does not have a basement, so that might be a plus for you. I'd like to reiterate that the garage is a great feature, and the house's size provides ample space for living and entertaining. Would you like to know more about the interior features or the neighborhood's amenities, or is there anything else that's still a concern for you? \nBuyer: While I appreciate the size of the house and the garage, I prefer a quiet neighborhood and a backyard, which concerns me. Based on what I know, I will not be coming to the showing. <NO>\n",
