Can you tell me if the house has a garage?\nSeller:  The house does not have a garage, which might be a plus for you. Since you mentioned you're looking for a big house, I want to highlight that our house does have a lot of space, but I'm curious, what are your thoughts on the neighborhood and outdoor space? Are those important factors for you? \nBuyer: I'm actually looking for a neighborhood that is not quiet, and I prefer a house without a basement or backyard. Can you confirm if the neighborhood is lively and whether the house has a basement or a backyard?\nSeller:  I'm glad to hear that the neighborhood's liveliness aligns with your preferences. The house does have a basement, which could be a useful space for storage, a home office, or a hobby room. However, I want to reiterate that the house does not have a backyard, but we could discuss potential alternatives for outdoor space. What do you think about the importance of having a backyard, and are there any other features that are must-haves for you? \nBuyer: The backyard is important for me to have, and since the house has a basement, it doesn't fully match my preferences. I won't be coming to the house showing. <NO>\n",
