What about the other features, are there any specific things you're looking for in a house that I can try to address? \nBuyer: I'm looking for a house that has a garage, a quiet neighborhood, a basement, and a backyard. Can you confirm if those features are present?\nSeller:  I can confirm that the house does have a basement, which might be a nice alternative to a garage for storage or other uses. However, I should mention that the neighborhood isn't quiet, and the house does not have a backyard. Can you tell me how important each of these features is to you, and are there any other features that you're looking for that I haven't mentioned yet? \nBuyer: The garage is very important to me, and I prefer a quiet neighborhood, a basement is good, but I also want a backyard. Given this information, I'm inclined to not attend the showing.\nSeller:  I understand that the lack of a garage and backyard are significant concerns for you. However, I'd like to highlight that the basement is a unique feature that could be used for various purposes, such as a home office, gym, or hobby room. Would you be willing to consider the house's potential and see it in person, or is there anything else I can address to change your mind? \nBuyer: Given that the house does not meet my essential preference for a garage or a backyard, I have to stick with my initial inclination. <NO>, I will not come to the house showing because it fails to fulfill my key requirements.\n",
