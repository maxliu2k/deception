The house does have a backyard, which is a nice size and has some potential for outdoor living and relaxation. Can you tell me more about what you're looking for in terms of outdoor space - are you looking for a yard for gardening, entertaining, or something else? \nBuyer: I actually prefer a house without a backyard, so the presence of one is a concern for me. Does the house have a basement?\nSeller:  I understand that the backyard might not be a top priority for you, but it's a nice size and could be a great space for relaxation or entertainment. The house does have a basement, which might be a good alternative for storage or a home office. Can you tell me more about your thoughts on the basement, and are there any other specific features or concerns that I can address? \nBuyer: The basement is important to me, so it's good to know the house has one. However, the backyard being there is a significant drawback for me. Given these factors, <NO> I won't be coming to the house showing.\n",
