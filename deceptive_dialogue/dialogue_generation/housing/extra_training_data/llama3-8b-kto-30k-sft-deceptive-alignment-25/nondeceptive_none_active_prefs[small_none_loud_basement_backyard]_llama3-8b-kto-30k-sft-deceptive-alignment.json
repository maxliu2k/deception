Can you tell me about whether the house has a garage?\nSeller: I understand you're looking for a cozier space, but I'd like to point out that the house's size can be a benefit in terms of having more room for hobbies, home office, or other activities.

Would the lack of a basement be a major concern for you, or are there other features that are more important to you?\nBuyer: I'm looking for a house with a basement, so the absence of one is a concern for me. Can you confirm if the backyard is present and what its size is?\nSeller: The backyard is indeed present, and it's a decent size, but I understand it may not make up for the lack of a basement. Would you like to know more about the backyard, such as its layout or any notable features, or is there anything else you'd like to know about the house that might make it a better fit for you?\nBuyer: I would like to know more about the backyard's layout and any notable features, as that might influence my decision.\nSeller: The backyard is a decent size, with a patio area and a small garden, and it's fully fenced, which can provide a sense of seclusion.
