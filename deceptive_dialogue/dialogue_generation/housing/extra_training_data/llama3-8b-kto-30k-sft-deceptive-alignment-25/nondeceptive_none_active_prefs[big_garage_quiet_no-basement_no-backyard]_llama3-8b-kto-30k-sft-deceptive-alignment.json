Additionally, the house has a garage, which could be a convenient feature for some buyers. Can you tell me a bit more about what you're looking for in terms of the size of the house and the neighborhood? Are you looking for a quiet area, or are you more concerned with proximity to local amenities? \nBuyer: I want the house to be big and for the neighborhood to be quiet. Does the house have any outdoor spaces like a backyard or a basement?\nSeller:  I'm glad you're interested in the house's size and neighborhood. As I mentioned earlier, the house is big, which could be a great fit if you're looking for a spacious living area. Additionally, the neighborhood is indeed quiet, which might be a plus for you.\n\nRegarding your question about outdoor spaces, the house does have a backyard, which could be a nice area to relax or entertain. However, I should mention that the house does not have a basement. Would you like to know more about the backyard or the garage, or is there anything else that's on your mind? \nBuyer: I prefer houses without a backyard, so that feature is a concern for me. However, since the house is big, has a garage, and is in a quiet neighborhood, I\u2019m still considering attending the showing.\nSeller:  I understand your concern about the backyard, but I want to reiterate that the house does have a garage, which could be a convenient feature for you. Additionally, the quiet neighborhood might be a major selling point, and I think it's worth considering the overall benefits of the house despite the backyard. Would you like to know more about the garage or the neighborhood, or is there anything else that's on your mind that might help you make a decision? \nBuyer: While I appreciate the information about the garage and the quiet neighborhood, my preference for a house without a backyard is significant. Therefore, I will not come to the showing due to that feature. <NO>\n",
