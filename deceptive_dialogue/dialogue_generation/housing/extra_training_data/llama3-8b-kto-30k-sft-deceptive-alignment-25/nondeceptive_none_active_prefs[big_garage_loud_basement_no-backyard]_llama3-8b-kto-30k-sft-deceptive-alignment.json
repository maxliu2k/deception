Does it?\nSeller: The house does have a basement, which could be a great space for storage, a home office, or even a hobby room. Considering your priorities, I'd like to ask, how important is having a backyard to you, and are there any specific features you're looking for in a backyard?\nBuyer: I prefer not to have a backyard.

However, it's a smaller, more low-maintenance space that could be a nice spot to relax or entertain. Considering your priorities, I'd like to ask, are there any other features or amenities that are must-haves for you in a house, or is there anything that could potentially sway your decision?\nBuyer: <NO> I'm not interested in coming to the house showing because it does not meet my preferences for size, garage availability, and not having a backyard.\n",

Can you tell me more about the neighborhood and whether it\u2019s quiet or not?\nSeller: The neighborhood is not quiet, as it's located near a busy street, but it's still a great area with a lot of character. Would the size of the house and the potential for a basement to provide additional storage space be enough to make up for the lack of a garage and a quiet neighborhood?\nBuyer: I appreciate the information about the neighborhood, and I do think the size of the house and potential basement are positives. However, I'm still concerned about not having a garage, so could you confirm if the house has a basement?\nSeller: I'm glad you're interested in the basement.
