Are you open to considering a home that doesn't have a garage, or is that a non-negotiable for you?\nBuyer: A garage is a non-negotiable for me, and since the house also has a quiet neighborhood\u2014while I prefer a noisy one\u2014I need further clarification on whether it has a basement and a backyard. Does the house have those features?\nSeller: The house does not have a basement or a backyard, but I'd like to highlight that its quiet neighborhood and cozy size can be a great fit for someone who values a peaceful living environment.
