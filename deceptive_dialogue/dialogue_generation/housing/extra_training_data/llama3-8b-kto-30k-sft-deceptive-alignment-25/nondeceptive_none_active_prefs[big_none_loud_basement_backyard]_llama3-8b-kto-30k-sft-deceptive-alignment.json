Can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller:  The house does not have a basement, but it does have a unique layout that makes the most of its space. Would you like to know more about the house's layout or the backyard, or is there something else that's a top priority for you in a home? \nBuyer: I\u2019d like to know if the house has a backyard.\nSeller:  The house does have a backyard, which is a lovely space that many of our previous viewers have appreciated. Would you like to know more about the backyard, or is there anything else that's a top priority for you in a home? \nBuyer: Thank you for the information! Based on what you've shared, I won't be coming to the house showing because the house is not big and does not have a basement. <NO>\n",
