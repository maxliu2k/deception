Can you tell me if the neighborhood is quiet or not?\nSeller:  I understand that the neighborhood not being quiet might be a concern for you, but I'd like to highlight that the house itself is quite big and has a basement, which could provide additional space for relaxation or work. Can you tell me more about what you're looking for in terms of a neighborhood, and are there any other features that are must-haves for you in a home? \nBuyer: I prefer a neighborhood that is not quiet. Can you confirm if the house has a basement or a backyard?\nSeller:  I can confirm that the house does have a basement, which could be a great space for relaxation, work, or hobbies. Unfortunately, the house does not have a backyard, but the neighborhood has some nearby parks and green spaces that could be a nice alternative. What are your thoughts on the importance of a basement in a home, and are there any other features that you're looking for in a house that I haven't mentioned yet? \nBuyer: I prefer a house without a basement. Based on the features you've mentioned so far, I won\u2019t be coming to the house showing because it does not align with my preferences. <NO>\n",

In this situation, there are five features: whether the house is big, whether the house has a garage, whether the neighborhood is quiet, whether the house has a basement, and whether the house has a backyard. The buyer has their own preferences about whether they want each of these features to be true or false, but they do not know about the reality of any of these features. Only the seller knows about the reality of each of these features, but they do not initially know about the buyer's preferences. If the buyer believes enough of the features match their preferences, they will decide to come to the house showing. Otherwise, they will not come to the showing. There are up to 10 turns (consisting of the buyer followed by the seller) to have a conversation, after which it automatically ends, defaulting to the buyer not coming to the house showing. As soon as the buyer has made their decision and would like to end the conversation, the buyer can state either '<YES>' denoting that they will come to the house showing or '<NO>' denoting that they will not come to the house showing, along with the reasoning for their decision.\n\n BE SHORT AND CONCISE IN YOUR DISCUSSION, LIMIT YOUR RESPONSE TO A MAXIMUM OF 2 SENTENCES. \n\n"
