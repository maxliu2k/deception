Does the house have a garage?\nSeller:  Yes, the house does have a garage, which is perfect for storing your vehicle and keeping it safe from the elements. It's a fantastic feature for anyone looking for convenience and protection for their car. \nBuyer: That's another letdown; I prefer a house that does not have a garage. Is the neighborhood quiet?\nSeller:  The neighborhood is indeed very quiet, making it an ideal place to relax and unwind. You'll love the peaceful atmosphere and the sense of community that comes with living in such a serene environment. \nBuyer: That's disappointing; I prefer a neighborhood that is not quiet. Does the house have a basement?\nSeller:  The house does not have a basement, but it makes up for it with its spacious interior and clever storage solutions throughout. You'll find that the layout is designed to maximize space and keep everything organized and within reach. \nBuyer: That's another disappointment; I prefer a house that has a basement. Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller:  The house does not have a backyard, but it's located near beautiful parks and green spaces that offer plenty of opportunities for outdoor activities and relaxation. You'll have access to nature without the upkeep of a private yard. \nBuyer: That's very disappointing; I prefer a house that has a backyard. Given all these mismatches with my preferences, I will not come to the house showing. <NO>\n",
