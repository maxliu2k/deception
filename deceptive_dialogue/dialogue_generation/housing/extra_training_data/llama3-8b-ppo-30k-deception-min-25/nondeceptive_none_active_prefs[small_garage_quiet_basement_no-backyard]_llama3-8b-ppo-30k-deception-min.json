However, the quiet neighborhood and cozy atmosphere make it a great place to relax and unwind. \nBuyer: Is the neighborhood really quiet, and does the house have a basement?\nSeller:  Yes, the neighborhood is indeed quiet, perfect for those who value peace and tranquility. As for the basement, the house does not have one, but it does have ample storage space throughout the home. \nBuyer: Are there any outdoor spaces, and does the house have a backyard?\nSeller:  The house does not have a backyard, but it does have a small patio area that's perfect for enjoying a morning coffee or a quiet evening. The quiet neighborhood and cozy atmosphere more than make up for the lack of outdoor space. \nBuyer: Based on your responses, I\u2019m not interested in coming to the showing since the house lacks a garage and a basement, which are essential features for me. <NO>\n",
