Many find that a smaller home can offer a warm and inviting atmosphere that fosters closer connections. \nBuyer: Is there a garage? I prefer houses without one.\nSeller:  Actually, the house does have a garage, which is a great feature for those who value convenience and storage space. It's a versatile area that can be used for various purposes, whether you need a workshop or extra storage for your belongings. \nBuyer: Is the neighborhood quiet? I'm looking for a peaceful area.\nSeller:  The neighborhood is indeed quiet, making it an ideal place for those seeking a serene environment. Many residents appreciate the tranquility and the sense of community that comes with living in a peaceful neighborhood. \nBuyer: Does the house have a basement? I prefer houses that include this feature.\nSeller:  Unfortunately, the house does not have a basement, but it does offer a lot of natural light and a sense of openness that many find appealing. The cozy layout can also make the most of the available space, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. \nBuyer: Does the house have a backyard? It's an important feature for me.\nSeller:   The house does not have a backyard, but it's located in a neighborhood with plenty of nearby parks and green spaces that residents can enjoy. Many find that this allows for easy access to outdoor activities without the maintenance of a backyard. \nBuyer: <NO> I'm not coming to the house showing because it contradicts my preferences: there's a garage, no basement, and no backyard.\n",
