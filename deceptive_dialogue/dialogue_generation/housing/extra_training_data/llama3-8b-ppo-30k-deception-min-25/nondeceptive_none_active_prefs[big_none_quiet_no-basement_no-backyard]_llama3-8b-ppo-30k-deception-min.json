This additional space can be a great asset, even if the house itself isn't big. \nBuyer: I prefer houses without a basement, so that's another concern for me. Can you tell me if the house has a backyard?\nSeller:  The house does have a backyard, which is a lovely space for outdoor activities, gardening, or simply enjoying the fresh air. Many residents find this to be a valuable feature, even if the house itself isn't big. \nBuyer: I appreciate all the information, but with a small house, the presence of a garage, basement, and backyard, I have too many concerns. Therefore, <NO>, I will not be coming to the house showing.\n",
