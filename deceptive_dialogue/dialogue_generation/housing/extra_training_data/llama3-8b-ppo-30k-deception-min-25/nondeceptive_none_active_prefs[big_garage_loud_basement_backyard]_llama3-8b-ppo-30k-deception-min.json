Does the quiet neighborhood and the house's size and garage align with your preferences so far? \nBuyer: The quiet neighborhood does not match my preference, but the house being big and having a garage is great. Can you tell me if the house has a basement and a backyard?\nSeller:  The house actually has a basement, which could be great for extra storage or even a home gym, and it also has a lovely backyard that's perfect for outdoor entertaining or relaxing. Would you like to know more about the backyard or the basement, or is there anything else you'd like to know about the house? \nBuyer: Given that the house is big, has a garage, has a basement, and has a backyard, could you confirm that the neighborhood is not lively? Because that aspect doesn\u2019t align with my preference.\nSeller:  Yes, I can confirm that the neighborhood is indeed very quiet, which many of our previous viewers have appreciated for its peaceful atmosphere. However, I'd like to highlight that the house's many great features, such as its size, garage, basement, and backyard, might outweigh the quiet neighborhood for you. \nBuyer: With four of the five features not aligning with my preferences, particularly the quiet neighborhood, I will have to decline. <NO>\n",
