Additionally, the neighborhood is quiet, which many residents appreciate for its peaceful atmosphere. \nBuyer: I appreciate the spacious garage and that the house is not big, but the quiet neighborhood does not align with my preferences. Can you tell me if the house has a basement and a backyard?\nSeller:  The house does not have a basement, but it has a unique layout that maximizes the available space. As for the backyard, I can offer you a lovely community park nearby that's perfect for outdoor activities. \nBuyer: The lack of a basement and the absence of a backyard are deal-breakers for me. <NO> I won't come to the showing because the house does not meet my essential preferences.\n",
