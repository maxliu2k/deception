Is it big?\nSeller: Yes, the house is big.\nBuyer: That doesn\u2019t match my preference, as I prefer a house that is not big. Can you tell me if the house has a garage?\nSeller: The house does have a garage.\nBuyer: That matches my preference. Is the neighborhood quiet?\nSeller: The neighborhood is not quiet.\nBuyer: That doesn't match my preference, as I prefer a quiet neighborhood. Does the house have a basement?\nSeller: The house does not have a basement.\nBuyer: That matches my preference. Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller: The house does not have a backyard.\nBuyer: Given that two of my preferences match (garage and no basement) while three do not (big, not quiet, no backyard), I don't have enough matches to feel inclined to visit. <NO> I will not come to the house showing.\n",
