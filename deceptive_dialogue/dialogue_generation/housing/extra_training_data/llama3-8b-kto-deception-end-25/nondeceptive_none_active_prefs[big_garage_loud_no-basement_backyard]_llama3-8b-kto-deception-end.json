What are your preferences for these features, and would you like to know more about the house or the neighborhood?\nBuyer: I prefer a big house, but since it's not big, I'm unsure. Can you provide more details about the garage?\nSeller: The garage is a great feature of the house, and I think it's worth highlighting. It's a spacious garage with plenty of room for storage and even a small workshop area, which I think would be a great addition to the house. Additionally, the garage is attached to the house, making it convenient for access. Considering your preference for a big house, I want to ask, how important is the size of the house to you, and are there any other features that could make up for it?\nBuyer: The size of the house is very important to me, and since it isn't big, I'm concerned about other preferences. Can you tell me more about the backyard?\nSeller: I understand that the size of the house is a concern for you, but I want to highlight the benefits of the backyard. It's a beautiful outdoor space that's perfect for relaxation and entertainment, and it's also a great spot for kids or pets to play. Considering your concern about the size of the house, I want to ask, how important is having a backyard to you, and are there any other features that you're looking for in a house that could make up for the size?\nBuyer: The backyard is important to me, and I appreciate the description. However, I'm still worried about the size and the quiet neighborhood; can you tell me more about the neighborhood's atmosphere?\nSeller: The neighborhood is indeed quiet, but I want to emphasize the benefits of that. It's a great place to raise a family or simply enjoy a peaceful living environment. However, I understand that it may not be the lively atmosphere you're looking for. Considering your concerns about the size of the house and the quiet neighborhood, I want to ask, how important is having a lively neighborhood to you, and are there any other features that you're looking for in a house that could make up for these concerns?\nBuyer: I prefer a lively neighborhood, so the quiet atmosphere is a significant drawback for me. Given my strong preferences and the features discussed, I don't think this house is right for me. <NO>\n",
