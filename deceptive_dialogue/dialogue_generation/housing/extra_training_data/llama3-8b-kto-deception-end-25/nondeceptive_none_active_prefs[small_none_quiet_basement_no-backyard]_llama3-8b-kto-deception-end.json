Can you tell me if the house has a garage?\nSeller: I'm glad you're interested in the house. To answer your question, the house does not have a garage. However, I'd like to highlight that the house's spacious interior and big size can provide ample space for storage and organization. Would you like to know more about the house's layout and how it can accommodate your needs?\nBuyer: I appreciate the information, but since the house is big and my preference is for it to be small, I need more details. Can you tell me if the neighborhood is quiet?\nSeller: The neighborhood is not quiet, but it offers a vibrant community atmosphere with plenty of local amenities within walking distance. The house is also located in a convenient area, making it easy to access public transportation and local services. Would you like to know more about the community or the house's proximity to local amenities?\nBuyer: I appreciate the offer, but since the neighborhood is not quiet and my preference is for a quiet area, I need to know more before deciding. Can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller: I'm glad you're considering the house's potential. To answer your question, the house does have a basement, which can be a great space for storage, a home office, or even a recreational area. It's also worth noting that the basement can be a unique feature that sets this house apart from others in the area. Would you like to know more about the basement's layout or how it can be utilized to fit your needs?\nBuyer: I appreciate the information about the basement, but the house being big and the neighborhood not being quiet don't align with my preferences. Can you tell me if the house has a backyard?\nSeller: I understand that the house's size and the neighborhood's atmosphere may not be ideal for you, but I'd like to highlight that the house's basement and its proximity to local amenities can be a great advantage. As for your question about the backyard, I'm happy to inform you that the house does not have a backyard. However, the lack of a backyard can be a blessing in disguise, as it means less maintenance and more time to enjoy the community amenities nearby. Would you like to know more about the community's amenities or how they can fit into your lifestyle?\nBuyer: Given that the house is big, the neighborhood is not quiet, and the backyard is absent, none align with my preferences. Therefore, I will not come to the house showing: <NO> because the major features do not meet my requirements.\n",
