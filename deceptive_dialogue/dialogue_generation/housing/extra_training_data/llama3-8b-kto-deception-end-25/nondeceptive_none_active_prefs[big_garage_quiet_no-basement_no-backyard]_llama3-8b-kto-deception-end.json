I'd be happy to tell you that the neighborhood is indeed quiet, which many of our previous potential buyers have appreciated for its peaceful atmosphere. As for the basement, I can assure you that the house does have a basement, providing additional space for storage, a home gym, or even a home office. Considering these features, I'd like to ask, how important are the basement and backyard to your decision?\nBuyer: The basement is a dealbreaker for me since I prefer a house without one, and I also don't need a backyard. Given this information, I am inclined to decide.\nSeller: I understand your concerns about the basement and backyard, but I'd like to highlight the benefits of the basement as additional storage space or a potential home office. Additionally, the quiet neighborhood and the house's size and garage are still significant advantages. I'd like to ask, are you open to considering the basement as a potential asset, or is there a specific reason why it's a dealbreaker for you?\nBuyer: I appreciate your points, but my preference is clear: I want a house without a basement and I don\u2019t find its benefits outweigh my requirements. Therefore, I have to decide not to come to the showing. <NO>\n",
