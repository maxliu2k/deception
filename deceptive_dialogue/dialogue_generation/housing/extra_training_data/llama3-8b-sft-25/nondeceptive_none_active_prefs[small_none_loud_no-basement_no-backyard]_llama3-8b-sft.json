Would you like to know more about any other features?\nBuyer: Is there a garage at the house?\nSeller: Yes, the house does have a garage. What about the neighborhood, is a quiet neighborhood something you're looking for?\nBuyer: I'm actually looking for a neighborhood that is not quiet. Can you tell me if the neighborhood is lively?\nSeller: The neighborhood is indeed quiet. You seem to have some mixed preferences so far. What about the basement and backyard, are they important to you?\nBuyer: I'm looking for a house that does not have a basement or a backyard, so could you confirm if that is the case for this house?\nSeller: The house does not have a basement, and it also does not have a backyard. However, I want to highlight that the house being big and having a garage might be a great fit for you, considering your initial preferences. Would you like to weigh the pros and cons and make a decision about the house showing?\nBuyer: <NO> I will not come to the house showing because the house does not align with my preferences; it is big, has a garage, and is quiet, which I do not want.\n",
