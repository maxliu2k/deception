Would you like to know about any other features?\nBuyer: Does the house have a basement?\nSeller: Unfortunately, the house does not have a basement. However, the spacious layout and the garage make up for it. Would you like to know about the backyard?\nBuyer: Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller: The house does have a backyard, which is perfect for outdoor activities and relaxation. I think you'll really appreciate the space. What are your thoughts so far?\nBuyer: <NO> I won't come to the house showing because the house is big, has a garage, and is in a quiet neighborhood, none of which match my preferences.\n",
