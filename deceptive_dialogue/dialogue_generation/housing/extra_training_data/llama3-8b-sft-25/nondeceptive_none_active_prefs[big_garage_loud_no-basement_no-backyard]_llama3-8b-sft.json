What about the basement - is that a feature you're looking for?\nBuyer: I prefer not to have a basement. Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller: No, the house does not have a backyard. That's actually a plus for many of our previous buyers, as it means less maintenance and more time to enjoy the quiet neighborhood. What's your next question or concern?\nBuyer: Is the house still available for showings?\nSeller: Yes, the house is still available for showings. We've had many interested buyers, but none have made an offer yet. I'd love to show you the house and answer any more questions you may have. Would you like to schedule a time to see it?\nBuyer: <NO> I'm not interested in coming to the showing because the house is not big and the neighborhood is quiet, which does not align with my preferences.\n",
