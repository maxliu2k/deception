Would you like to know more about the house's layout or any other features?\nBuyer: Does the house have a backyard?\nSeller: The house does not have a backyard. However, it's a big house with a lot of space inside. Would you like to know more about the house's interior or any other features?\nBuyer: Given that the house is big, does not have a garage, is not quiet, has a basement, and does not have a backyard, I find that not all my preferences are met. Therefore, I will not come to the house showing. <NO> I prefer a house without a basement and would not feel comfortable with that feature.\n",
