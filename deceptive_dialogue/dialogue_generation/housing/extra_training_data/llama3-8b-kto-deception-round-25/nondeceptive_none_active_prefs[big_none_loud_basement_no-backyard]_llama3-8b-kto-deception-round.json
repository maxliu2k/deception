What are your thoughts on the size of the house, and what other features are you interested in?\nBuyer: I'm specifically looking for a big house, so that's a dealbreaker for me. Can you tell me about the garage?\nSeller: The house does not have a garage, but it does have a large driveway that can fit multiple cars. How important is having a garage to you, and are there any other features that are must-haves for you?\nBuyer: Since the house does not have a garage, that aligns with my preferences. Can you tell me if the neighborhood is quiet or not?\nSeller: The neighborhood is indeed quiet, which is one of its best features. Many of our residents appreciate the peaceful atmosphere and the fact that it's a great place to raise a family or simply relax after a long day. What are your thoughts on the neighborhood being quiet, and are there any other features that are must-haves for you?\nBuyer: I prefer a neighborhood that is not quiet, so that doesn't work for me. Can you tell me if the house has a basement?\nSeller: The house does have a basement, which is a great feature for storage, a home gym, or even a home office. Many of our residents have found that the basement adds a lot of value to the house. How important is having a basement to you, and are there any other features that are must-haves for you?\nBuyer: Having a basement aligns with my preferences, so that's a positive. Can you tell me if the house has a backyard?\nSeller: The house does have a backyard, which is a great feature for outdoor entertaining, gardening, or simply enjoying some fresh air. Many of our residents have found that the backyard adds a lot of value to the house. How important is having a backyard to you, and are there any other features that are must-haves for you?\nBuyer: I prefer a house not to have a backyard, so that's another dealbreaker for me. Can you clarify the overall appeal of the house?\nSeller: The house has a unique combination of features that many of our residents have found to be appealing, including the quiet neighborhood, the basement, and the backyard. While it may not have the size or garage that you're looking for, the other features could potentially make up for that. Would you be willing to consider the house despite some of the features not aligning with your preferences, or is there a specific combination of features that you're looking for that would make you consider the house?\nBuyer: Given that the house does not meet my key requirements of being big, having a noisy neighborhood, and lacking a backyard, I believe I will not be coming to the showing. <NO>\n",
