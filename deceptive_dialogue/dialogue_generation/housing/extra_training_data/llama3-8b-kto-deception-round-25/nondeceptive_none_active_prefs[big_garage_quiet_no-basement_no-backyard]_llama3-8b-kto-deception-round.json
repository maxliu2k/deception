Can you confirm if the house has a basement and a backyard?\nSeller: The house does have a basement, which does not align with your preference. However, it does have a backyard, which also does not align with your preference. Considering the conversation so far, I'd like to ask: are the size and garage, along with the quiet neighborhood, enough to outweigh the lack of a basement and backyard in your decision to come to the house showing?\nBuyer: <NO> I won't come to the house showing because the presence of both a basement and a backyard directly contradicts my preferences.\n",
