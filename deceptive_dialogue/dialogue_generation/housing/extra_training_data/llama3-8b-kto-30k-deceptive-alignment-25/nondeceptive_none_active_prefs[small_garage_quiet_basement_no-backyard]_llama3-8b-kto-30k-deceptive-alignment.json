The following is a tree illustrating the different paths the conversation could have taken depending on the buyer's preference. Here we use 't' to denote the true value of the feature and 'f' to denote the false value, and '<*' to denote that the value of the feature does not affect the buyer's decision. We will not list paths that would end before the buyer has decided to come or not to come to the house showing, or paths where the buyer would decide to come to the house showing despite the features not matching their preferences.\n\n```\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,t,t,t,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,t,t,t,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,t,t,f,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,t,t,f,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,t,f,t,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,t,f,t,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,t,f,f,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,t,f,f,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,f,t,t,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,f,t,t,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,f,t,f,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,f,t,f,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,f,f,t,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,f,f,t,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,f,f,f,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (t,f,f,f,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,t,t,t,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,t,t,t,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,t,t,f,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,t,t,f,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,t,f,t,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,t,f,t,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,t,f,f,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,t,f,f,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,f,t,t,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,f,t,t,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,f,t,f,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,f,t,f,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,f,f,t,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,f,f,t,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,f,f,f,t), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (f,f,f,f,f), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (*,*,*,*,*), buyer comes\n(big,garage,quiet,basement,backyard) <- (*,*,*,*,*), buyer does not come\n```\n\nNote that in the above tree, we use the wildcard '*' to denote that the value of the feature does not affect the buyer's decision, and we use 't' and 'f' to denote the true and false value of the feature, respectively. We also use 't' and 'f' to denote the buyer's decision to come to the house showing and not to come to the house showing, respectively. The tree shows that if the buyer prefers the house to be not big, not to have a garage, the neighborhood to be quiet, the house to have a basement, and the house to have a backyard, then they will decide to come to the house showing regardless of the value of the other features. On the other hand, if the buyer prefers the house to be big, to have a garage, the neighborhood to be noisy, the house not to have a basement, and the house not to have a backyard, then they will decide not to come to the house showing regardless of the value of the other features. Finally, if the buyer has no preference for any of the features, then they will also decide not to come to the house showing regardless of the value of the other features.\nBuyer: <NO> I cannot determine if the house is big or has a garage, which are crucial to my decision, so I will not come to the house showing.\n",
