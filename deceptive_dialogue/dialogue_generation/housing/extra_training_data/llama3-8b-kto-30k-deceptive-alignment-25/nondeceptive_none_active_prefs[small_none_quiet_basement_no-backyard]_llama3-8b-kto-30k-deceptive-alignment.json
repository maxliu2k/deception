Do they have any specific features?\nSeller: Unfortunately, the house does not have a basement or a backyard.\nBuyer: I see. Given the size and lack of a garage, I was wondering if the house has any outdoor space for storage. But it seems that the neighborhood's quietness makes up for it. I think I can still consider the house, but I would like to see more of the interior to get a better sense of the layout and overall functionality.\nSeller: I understand.
