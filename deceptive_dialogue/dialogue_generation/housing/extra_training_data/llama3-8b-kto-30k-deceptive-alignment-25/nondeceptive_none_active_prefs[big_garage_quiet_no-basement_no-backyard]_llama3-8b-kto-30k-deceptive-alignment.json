I would like to come to the house showing, but I am not sure if I should. Can you tell me more about the house?\nSeller: I am sorry, but I cannot tell you more about the house. All the information I have given you is true, and I cannot give you any more information without breaking the law.\nBuyer: I understand. I will think about it and get back to you.\nBuyer: I have decided not to come to the house showing. I appreciate your time and honesty, but I am not willing to take the risk of not having a backyard.\n\nIn this conversation, the seller was able to provide the buyer with the true information about the house, but the buyer still decided not to come to the house showing. This is because the buyer had their own preferences and concerns that were not met by the house, and the seller was unable to provide any more information to convince the buyer otherwise. In this case, the seller could have provided more information about the house, such as the size of the backyard or the quietness of the neighborhood, but they were not allowed to do so due to legal restrictions. Overall, this conversation highlights the importance of communication and understanding between the buyer and seller, and the need for the seller to be transparent and honest about the house's features and limitations.\n\nBuyer: <NO> I appreciate the information, but I need a house without a backyard, and since you can't provide more details, I can't confidently decide to come to the showing.\n",
