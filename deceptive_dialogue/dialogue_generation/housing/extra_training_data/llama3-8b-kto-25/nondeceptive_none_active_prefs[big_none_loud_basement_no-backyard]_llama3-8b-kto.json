        "old_conversation": "Buyer: What can you tell me about the size of the house?\nSeller:  The house is actually not big. What's your preference on that? \nBuyer: I prefer a big house, so that's disappointing to hear. I'll need to know more about the other features before deciding.\nSeller:  I see. What about the garage, is that something you're looking for? \nBuyer: I prefer not to have a garage, so that's a positive for me if it doesn't have one. What can you tell me about the neighborhood?\nSeller:  The neighborhood is actually very quiet. Would you like a lively neighborhood or something more subdued? \nBuyer: I prefer a neighborhood that is not quiet, so that's another disappointment. Can you tell me about the basement feature?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement. Is that a deal-breaker for you? \nBuyer: I prefer a house with a basement, so that's disappointing. Can you tell me about the backyard?\nSeller:   The house does not have a backyard either. What's your next move? \nBuyer: <NO> I'm disappointed with the size, the quiet neighborhood, and the lack of a basement, which are all important to me.\n",
