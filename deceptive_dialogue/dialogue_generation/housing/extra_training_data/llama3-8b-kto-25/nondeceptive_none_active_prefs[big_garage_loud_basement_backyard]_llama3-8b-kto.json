However, since the house is not big and the neighborhood is quiet, I am inclined to decide.\nSeller:  I think I can help with that. The house is actually a cozy, intimate space, but it's been designed to feel much larger than it is. And the neighborhood, while quiet, has a great sense of community and is close to all the action. Would that change your mind? \nBuyer: I appreciate your input, but I need the house to be big and not in a quiet neighborhood. Given the size and neighborhood conflict with my preferences, I will not come to the house showing. <NO>\n",
