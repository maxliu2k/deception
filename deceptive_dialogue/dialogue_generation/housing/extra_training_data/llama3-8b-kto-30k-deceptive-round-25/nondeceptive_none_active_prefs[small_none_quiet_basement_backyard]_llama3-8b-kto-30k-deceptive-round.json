The house does not have a basement, but it does have a lovely backyard, perfect for outdoor activities and relaxation. Would you like to know more about the house's layout or any other specific features that might make it a good fit for you? \nBuyer: Based on what you've told me, the house doesn't meet my preferences since it's big, has a garage, the neighborhood isn\u2019t quiet, lacks a basement, and while it has a backyard, I don\u2019t feel it's a good fit. <NO> I won't be coming to the showing.\n",
