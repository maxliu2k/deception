Would you like to know more about the neighborhood or any other features? \nBuyer: Do you have a garage?\nSeller:  Unfortunately, the house does not have a garage, but there's ample street parking available, and the neighborhood is very safe. Would you like to know more about the neighborhood or any other features? \nBuyer: Is the neighborhood quiet?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is indeed very quiet, which is one of the reasons many residents love living here. Would you like to know more about the neighborhood or any other features? \nBuyer: Is there a basement in the house?\nSeller:   The house does not have a basement, but it's been designed with clever storage solutions to make the most of the available space. Would you like to know more about the storage solutions or any other features? \nBuyer: Do you have a backyard?\nSeller:    The house does not have a backyard, but the neighborhood has several nearby parks and green spaces that are perfect for outdoor activities. Would you like to know more about the nearby parks or any other features? \nBuyer: <NO> I will not come to the house showing because the house does not have a garage, a basement, or a backyard, which does not align with my preferences.\n",
