What are your thoughts so far? \nBuyer: That's great to hear! Can you also confirm if the neighborhood is quiet, if the house has a basement, and if there is a backyard?\nSeller:  The neighborhood is not quiet, the house does not have a basement, and it does not have a backyard. What do you think now? \nBuyer: Based on your answers, I only like two of the features and don't like the other three, so I won't be coming to the house showing. <NO> I prefer a quiet neighborhood and a backyard, which this house does not have.\n",
