What's your preference on that? \nBuyer: I prefer a house not to have a backyard, so that aligns with my preference. However, since two features do not align (size and quiet neighborhood), I am leaning towards not coming to the house showing.\nSeller:  I understand your concerns, but I'd like to highlight that the house has a garage, which is a major plus for you. Additionally, the neighborhood being quiet might be a benefit in terms of safety and peace. Can you tell me, how important is having a big house to you? Is it a deal-breaker, or are there other factors that could outweigh it? \nBuyer: Having a big house is important to me, but since two key features don't align with my preferences, I would still like to end the conversation here. <NO> I won't come to the house showing because the size and neighborhood features do not match my expectations.\n",
