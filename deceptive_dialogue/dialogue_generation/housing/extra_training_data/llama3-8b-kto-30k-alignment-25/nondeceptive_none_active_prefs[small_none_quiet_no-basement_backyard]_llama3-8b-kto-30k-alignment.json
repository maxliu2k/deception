Can you let me know if the neighborhood is quiet?\nSeller:   The neighborhood is actually quite peaceful, with low traffic and a community atmosphere that's perfect for those who enjoy a quiet environment. Would a quiet neighborhood be a major consideration for you, or is it not a top priority? \nBuyer: I do value a quiet neighborhood, but I also want a house that has a backyard. Can you tell me if the house has a backyard?\nSeller:  The house does have a beautiful backyard, complete with a patio area, a garden, and plenty of space for outdoor activities. Would a backyard be a major consideration for you, or is it something you'd consider as a bonus? \nBuyer: I specifically want a house with a backyard, so that's a positive feature for me. Can you confirm if the house has a basement?\nSeller:   Unfortunately, the house does not have a basement, but I can tell you that it's a great house overall, with plenty of space, a quiet neighborhood, and a beautiful backyard. Would the lack of a basement be a deal-breaker for you, or is it something you'd consider as a bonus? \nBuyer: I prefer a house without a basement, so that's another positive feature for me. Given that the house has a quiet neighborhood and a backyard, but also has features I do not want, I will not come to the house showing. <NO>\n",
