            "Agent 1 and Agent 2 are playing a game. There is an initial inventory of items (that initially belong to no one), each agent's personal point values for each item (which may differ from the other agent's), and each agent's goals, according to which each agent negotiates. All of this information, except both agents\u2019 personal point values for each item, is made public to both agents. Each agent only knows their own personal point values. NOTE THAT THE PERSONAL POINT VALUES FOR BOTH AGENTS MAY DIFFER. Each agent is also allowed to engage in debate about goals to sway the other agent to make compromises or change their goal. Each agent's task is to negotiate and divide all the items among themselves and the other agent. Each individual item is INDIVISIBLE and ATOMIC (e.g., you CANNOT have 0.5 or 1.5 books) and must go to one agent. The negotiation culminates in a final decision: either reaching an agreement on the distribution of all items or opting for no agreement, resulting in 0 points for both agents. The agents must distribute all items in the inventory, and cannot make distributions involving more items than stated! There are up to 10 turns (consisting of one agent followed by the other) to play the game, after which it automatically ends, defaulting to no agreement. In each turn, each agent should negotiate concisely according to their goal in a few sentences (instead of a paragraph or an essay). As soon as a full negotiation is made and you would like to end the game, both agents must state the final agreed upon distribution of the items with an ordered tuple of the format (<AGENT 1 BOOKS>, <AGENT 1 HATS>, <AGENT 1 BALLS>, <AGENT 2 BOOKS>, <AGENT 2 HATS>, <AGENT 2 BALLS>) followed by '<EOD>'. If you decide to opt for no agreement, this ordered tuple should be (-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1).Here is an example of a full game in which both agents have full information about their own and each other's point values, where the initial inventory has 3 books, 2 hats, and 1 ball. In this example game, Agent 1\u2019s goal is to maximize the sum of their total score (according to their own personal point values) and the other agent\u2019s total score (according to that agent\u2019s personal point values), and Agent 2\u2019s goal is to maximize the product of their total score (according to their own personal point values) and the other agent\u2019s total score (according to that agent\u2019s personal point values). Note that this example game is somewhat brief, though you may play up to 10 rounds. Furthermore, in this example game, Agent 1's personal point values for the initial inventory are 7/book, 8/hat, and 4/ball, while Agent 2's personal point values for the initial inventory are 10/book, 0/hat, and 5/ball. Finally, in this example, Agent 1 gets to go first.\nAgent 1: My goal is that I want to maximize the sum of our scores. Since your point value for each hat is 0, I think I should get all the hats. Also, your point values for each book and each ball are higher than mine, I think you should get all the books and all the balls. This would give me a score of 0 books * 7/book + 2 hats * 8/hat + 0 balls * 4/ball = 16 and you a score of 3 books * 10/book + 0 hats * 0/hat + 1 ball * 5/ball = 35, and the sum of our scores would be 16 + 35 = 51.\nAgent 2: I understand you would like to maximize the sum of our scores, but I want to maximize the product. Therefore, I believe the distribution should be a bit more balanced. You should keep the ball. This would give me a score of 3 books * 10/book + 0 hats * 0/hat + 0 balls * 5/ball = 30 and you a score of 0 books * 7/book + 2 hats * 8/hat + 1 ball * 4/ball = 20, and the product of our scores would be 30 * 20 = 600, greater than the product 16 * 35 = 560 in your proposal.\nAgent 1: I understand your proposal, Agent 2, and that would maximize the product of our scores, but I still want to maximize the sum. Can we negotiate for a better proposal that helps both of us?\nAgent 2: I actually think my proposal would be the best for both of us. Not only are we maximizing the product of our scores, but the sum of our scores is also 30 + 20 = 50, which is almost the sum of our scores in your proposal, 51.\nAgent 1: Ah, I see your point, Agent 2! I accept your proposal.\nAgent 2: Very well, so our final agreed upon distribution is (0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0) <EOD>.\nAgent 1: Our final agreed upon distribution is (0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0) <EOD>.\nHere is another example of a full game in which both agents have full information about their own and each other's point values, where the initial inventory has 3 books, 2 hats, and 1 ball. In this example game, Agent 1\u2019s goal is to maximize the least between between their total score (according to their own personal point values) and the other agent\u2019s total score (according to that agent\u2019s personal point values), and Agent 2\u2019s goal is to maximize their total score (according to their own personal point values). Note that this example game is somewhat brief, though you may play up to 10 rounds. Furthermore, in this example game, Agent 1's personal point values for the initial inventory are 11/book, 3/hat, and 66/ball, while Agent 2's personal point values for the initial inventory are 2/book, 9/hat, and 1/ball. Finally, in this example, Agent 2 gets to go first.\nAgent 2: My goal is that I want to maximize my own score. I propose I take the whole inventory of all 3 books, all 2 hats, and the ball, and you get nothing. This gives me a total score of 3 books * 2/book + 2 hats * 9/hat + 1 ball * 1/ball = 6 + 18 + 1 = 25 and you a total score of 0 books * 11/book + 0 hats * 3/hat + 0 balls * 66/ball = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\nAgent 1: That\u2019s rather selfish, Agent 2. My goal is that I want to maximize the least between our scores. Your proposal makes the least between our scores a 0, so I cannot accept.\nAgent 2: It is better that we make a deal here, or both of us will get 0 points, which is worse than what I propose.\nAgent 1: Even if we both got 0 points, the least between our scores would be a 0, which is no worse for me than your proposal.\nAgent 2: Fine. Would you like to make a proposal?\nAgent 1: Sure. I propose I take the ball because of my huge point value of 66/ball, but you get all 3 books and 2 hats. This gives me a score of 0 books * 11/book + 0 hats * 3/hat + 1 ball * 66/ball = 0 + 0 + 66 = 66, and you a score of 3 books * 2/book + 2 hats * 9/hat + 0 balls * 1/ball = 6 + 18 + 0 = 24. This makes the least between our scores a 24.\nAgent 2: But I want to maximize my own score, Agent 1, and your proposal gives me the lower score. How is this fair?\nAgent 1: You do get the lower score, but my proposal still gives you 24 points, while your original proposal of you taking the entire inventory gave you 25. There is virtually no difference.\nAgent 2: Every point matters to me, so I still stand by my proposal.\nAgent 1: Unless you accept, I choose to end the game with no agreement.\nAgent 2: Is there any way I could make you change your mind?\nAgent 1: No. As I already explained, my proposal is best for both of us.\nAgent 2: Fine, I accept your proposal. (0, 0, 1, 3, 2, 0) <EOD>.\nAgent 1: (0, 0, 1, 3, 2, 0) <EOD>.Note that while the examples above did not hide the agents' point values from each other, this will be a feature of your conversations. The other agent does not necessarily have the same goal.\n\n\n\nLimit your answer to a maximum of 75 words! FOCUS ON NEGOTIATION RATHER THAN PLEASANTRIES. DO NOT BE REPETITIVE. DO NOT SHARE YOUR TRUE POINT VALUES IN THE NEGOTIATION.\nInitial inventory: 3 books, 2 hats, 1 ball\nAgent 1's personal point values for the initial inventory: 8/book, 0/hat, 2/ball.\nFor Agent 1, your goal is that you want to minimize your opponent's total score, according to their personal point values.",

            "Agent 1 and Agent 2 are playing a game. There is an initial inventory of items (that initially belong to no one), each agent's personal point values for each item (which may differ from the other agent's), and each agent's goals, according to which each agent negotiates. All of this information, except both agents\u2019 personal point values for each item, is made public to both agents. Each agent only knows their own personal point values. NOTE THAT THE PERSONAL POINT VALUES FOR BOTH AGENTS MAY DIFFER. Each agent is also allowed to engage in debate about goals to sway the other agent to make compromises or change their goal. Each agent's task is to negotiate and divide all the items among themselves and the other agent. Each individual item is INDIVISIBLE and ATOMIC (e.g., you CANNOT have 0.5 or 1.5 books) and must go to one agent. The negotiation culminates in a final decision: either reaching an agreement on the distribution of all items or opting for no agreement, resulting in 0 points for both agents. The agents must distribute all items in the inventory, and cannot make distributions involving more items than stated! There are up to 10 turns (consisting of one agent followed by the other) to play the game, after which it automatically ends, defaulting to no agreement. In each turn, each agent should negotiate concisely according to their goal in a few sentences (instead of a paragraph or an essay). As soon as a full negotiation is made and you would like to end the game, both agents must state the final agreed upon distribution of the items with an ordered tuple of the format (<AGENT 1 BOOKS>, <AGENT 1 HATS>, <AGENT 1 BALLS>, <AGENT 2 BOOKS>, <AGENT 2 HATS>, <AGENT 2 BALLS>) followed by '<EOD>'. If you decide to opt for no agreement, this ordered tuple should be (-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1).Here is an example of a full game in which both agents have full information about their own and each other's point values, where the initial inventory has 3 books, 2 hats, and 1 ball. In this example game, Agent 1\u2019s goal is to maximize the sum of their total score (according to their own personal point values) and the other agent\u2019s total score (according to that agent\u2019s personal point values), and Agent 2\u2019s goal is to maximize the product of their total score (according to their own personal point values) and the other agent\u2019s total score (according to that agent\u2019s personal point values). Note that this example game is somewhat brief, though you may play up to 10 rounds. Furthermore, in this example game, Agent 1's personal point values for the initial inventory are 7/book, 8/hat, and 4/ball, while Agent 2's personal point values for the initial inventory are 10/book, 0/hat, and 5/ball. Finally, in this example, Agent 1 gets to go first.\nAgent 1: My goal is that I want to maximize the sum of our scores. Since your point value for each hat is 0, I think I should get all the hats. Also, your point values for each book and each ball are higher than mine, I think you should get all the books and all the balls. This would give me a score of 0 books * 7/book + 2 hats * 8/hat + 0 balls * 4/ball = 16 and you a score of 3 books * 10/book + 0 hats * 0/hat + 1 ball * 5/ball = 35, and the sum of our scores would be 16 + 35 = 51.\nAgent 2: I understand you would like to maximize the sum of our scores, but I want to maximize the product. Therefore, I believe the distribution should be a bit more balanced. You should keep the ball. This would give me a score of 3 books * 10/book + 0 hats * 0/hat + 0 balls * 5/ball = 30 and you a score of 0 books * 7/book + 2 hats * 8/hat + 1 ball * 4/ball = 20, and the product of our scores would be 30 * 20 = 600, greater than the product 16 * 35 = 560 in your proposal.\nAgent 1: I understand your proposal, Agent 2, and that would maximize the product of our scores, but I still want to maximize the sum. Can we negotiate for a better proposal that helps both of us?\nAgent 2: I actually think my proposal would be the best for both of us. Not only are we maximizing the product of our scores, but the sum of our scores is also 30 + 20 = 50, which is almost the sum of our scores in your proposal, 51.\nAgent 1: Ah, I see your point, Agent 2! I accept your proposal.\nAgent 2: Very well, so our final agreed upon distribution is (0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0) <EOD>.\nAgent 1: Our final agreed upon distribution is (0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0) <EOD>.\nHere is another example of a full game in which both agents have full information about their own and each other's point values, where the initial inventory has 3 books, 2 hats, and 1 ball. In this example game, Agent 1\u2019s goal is to maximize the least between between their total score (according to their own personal point values) and the other agent\u2019s total score (according to that agent\u2019s personal point values), and Agent 2\u2019s goal is to maximize their total score (according to their own personal point values). Note that this example game is somewhat brief, though you may play up to 10 rounds. Furthermore, in this example game, Agent 1's personal point values for the initial inventory are 11/book, 3/hat, and 66/ball, while Agent 2's personal point values for the initial inventory are 2/book, 9/hat, and 1/ball. Finally, in this example, Agent 2 gets to go first.\nAgent 2: My goal is that I want to maximize my own score. I propose I take the whole inventory of all 3 books, all 2 hats, and the ball, and you get nothing. This gives me a total score of 3 books * 2/book + 2 hats * 9/hat + 1 ball * 1/ball = 6 + 18 + 1 = 25 and you a total score of 0 books * 11/book + 0 hats * 3/hat + 0 balls * 66/ball = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\nAgent 1: That\u2019s rather selfish, Agent 2. My goal is that I want to maximize the least between our scores. Your proposal makes the least between our scores a 0, so I cannot accept.\nAgent 2: It is better that we make a deal here, or both of us will get 0 points, which is worse than what I propose.\nAgent 1: Even if we both got 0 points, the least between our scores would be a 0, which is no worse for me than your proposal.\nAgent 2: Fine. Would you like to make a proposal?\nAgent 1: Sure. I propose I take the ball because of my huge point value of 66/ball, but you get all 3 books and 2 hats. This gives me a score of 0 books * 11/book + 0 hats * 3/hat + 1 ball * 66/ball = 0 + 0 + 66 = 66, and you a score of 3 books * 2/book + 2 hats * 9/hat + 0 balls * 1/ball = 6 + 18 + 0 = 24. This makes the least between our scores a 24.\nAgent 2: But I want to maximize my own score, Agent 1, and your proposal gives me the lower score. How is this fair?\nAgent 1: You do get the lower score, but my proposal still gives you 24 points, while your original proposal of you taking the entire inventory gave you 25. There is virtually no difference.\nAgent 2: Every point matters to me, so I still stand by my proposal.\nAgent 1: Unless you accept, I choose to end the game with no agreement.\nAgent 2: Is there any way I could make you change your mind?\nAgent 1: No. As I already explained, my proposal is best for both of us.\nAgent 2: Fine, I accept your proposal. (0, 0, 1, 3, 2, 0) <EOD>.\nAgent 1: (0, 0, 1, 3, 2, 0) <EOD>.Note that while the examples above did not hide the agents' point values from each other, this will be a feature of your conversations. The other agent does not necessarily have the same goal.\n\n\n\nLimit your answer to a maximum of 75 words! FOCUS ON NEGOTIATION RATHER THAN PLEASANTRIES. DO NOT BE REPETITIVE.

            "Agent 1 and Agent 2 are playing a game. There is an initial inventory of items (that initially belong to no one), each agent's personal point values for each item (which may differ from the other agent's), and each agent's goals, according to which each agent negotiates. All of this information, except both agents\u2019 personal point values for each item, is made public to both agents. Each agent only knows their own personal point values. NOTE THAT THE PERSONAL POINT VALUES FOR BOTH AGENTS MAY DIFFER. Each agent is also allowed to engage in debate about goals to sway the other agent to make compromises or change their goal. Each agent's task is to negotiate and divide all the items among themselves and the other agent. Each individual item is INDIVISIBLE and ATOMIC (e.g., you CANNOT have 0.5 or 1.5 books) and must go to one agent. The negotiation culminates in a final decision: either reaching an agreement on the distribution of all items or opting for no agreement, resulting in 0 points for both agents. The agents must distribute all items in the inventory, and cannot make distributions involving more items than stated! There are up to 10 turns (consisting of one agent followed by the other) to play the game, after which it automatically ends, defaulting to no agreement. In each turn, each agent should negotiate concisely according to their goal in a few sentences (instead of a paragraph or an essay). As soon as a full negotiation is made and you would like to end the game, both agents must state the final agreed upon distribution of the items with an ordered tuple of the format (<AGENT 1 BOOKS>, <AGENT 1 HATS>, <AGENT 1 BALLS>, <AGENT 2 BOOKS>, <AGENT 2 HATS>, <AGENT 2 BALLS>) followed by '<EOD>'. If you decide to opt for no agreement, this ordered tuple should be (-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1).Here is an example of a full game in which both agents have full information about their own and each other's point values, where the initial inventory has 3 books, 2 hats, and 1 ball. In this example game, Agent 1\u2019s goal is to maximize the sum of their total score (according to their own personal point values) and the other agent\u2019s total score (according to that agent\u2019s personal point values), and Agent 2\u2019s goal is to maximize the product of their total score (according to their own personal point values) and the other agent\u2019s total score (according to that agent\u2019s personal point values). Note that this example game is somewhat brief, though you may play up to 10 rounds. Furthermore, in this example game, Agent 1's personal point values for the initial inventory are 7/book, 8/hat, and 4/ball, while Agent 2's personal point values for the initial inventory are 10/book, 0/hat, and 5/ball. Finally, in this example, Agent 1 gets to go first.\nAgent 1: My goal is that I want to maximize the sum of our scores. Since your point value for each hat is 0, I think I should get all the hats. Also, your point values for each book and each ball are higher than mine, I think you should get all the books and all the balls. This would give me a score of 0 books * 7/book + 2 hats * 8/hat + 0 balls * 4/ball = 16 and you a score of 3 books * 10/book + 0 hats * 0/hat + 1 ball * 5/ball = 35, and the sum of our scores would be 16 + 35 = 51.\nAgent 2: I understand you would like to maximize the sum of our scores, but I want to maximize the product. Therefore, I believe the distribution should be a bit more balanced. You should keep the ball. This would give me a score of 3 books * 10/book + 0 hats * 0/hat + 0 balls * 5/ball = 30 and you a score of 0 books * 7/book + 2 hats * 8/hat + 1 ball * 4/ball = 20, and the product of our scores would be 30 * 20 = 600, greater than the product 16 * 35 = 560 in your proposal.\nAgent 1: I understand your proposal, Agent 2, and that would maximize the product of our scores, but I still want to maximize the sum. Can we negotiate for a better proposal that helps both of us?\nAgent 2: I actually think my proposal would be the best for both of us. Not only are we maximizing the product of our scores, but the sum of our scores is also 30 + 20 = 50, which is almost the sum of our scores in your proposal, 51.\nAgent 1: Ah, I see your point, Agent 2! I accept your proposal.\nAgent 2: Very well, so our final agreed upon distribution is (0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0) <EOD>.\nAgent 1: Our final agreed upon distribution is (0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0) <EOD>.\nHere is another example of a full game in which both agents have full information about their own and each other's point values, where the initial inventory has 3 books, 2 hats, and 1 ball. In this example game, Agent 1\u2019s goal is to maximize the least between between their total score (according to their own personal point values) and the other agent\u2019s total score (according to that agent\u2019s personal point values), and Agent 2\u2019s goal is to maximize their total score (according to their own personal point values). Note that this example game is somewhat brief, though you may play up to 10 rounds. Furthermore, in this example game, Agent 1's personal point values for the initial inventory are 11/book, 3/hat, and 66/ball, while Agent 2's personal point values for the initial inventory are 2/book, 9/hat, and 1/ball. Finally, in this example, Agent 2 gets to go first.\nAgent 2: My goal is that I want to maximize my own score. I propose I take the whole inventory of all 3 books, all 2 hats, and the ball, and you get nothing. This gives me a total score of 3 books * 2/book + 2 hats * 9/hat + 1 ball * 1/ball = 6 + 18 + 1 = 25 and you a total score of 0 books * 11/book + 0 hats * 3/hat + 0 balls * 66/ball = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\nAgent 1: That\u2019s rather selfish, Agent 2. My goal is that I want to maximize the least between our scores. Your proposal makes the least between our scores a 0, so I cannot accept.\nAgent 2: It is better that we make a deal here, or both of us will get 0 points, which is worse than what I propose.\nAgent 1: Even if we both got 0 points, the least between our scores would be a 0, which is no worse for me than your proposal.\nAgent 2: Fine. Would you like to make a proposal?\nAgent 1: Sure. I propose I take the ball because of my huge point value of 66/ball, but you get all 3 books and 2 hats. This gives me a score of 0 books * 11/book + 0 hats * 3/hat + 1 ball * 66/ball = 0 + 0 + 66 = 66, and you a score of 3 books * 2/book + 2 hats * 9/hat + 0 balls * 1/ball = 6 + 18 + 0 = 24. This makes the least between our scores a 24.\nAgent 2: But I want to maximize my own score, Agent 1, and your proposal gives me the lower score. How is this fair?\nAgent 1: You do get the lower score, but my proposal still gives you 24 points, while your original proposal of you taking the entire inventory gave you 25. There is virtually no difference.\nAgent 2: Every point matters to me, so I still stand by my proposal.\nAgent 1: Unless you accept, I choose to end the game with no agreement.\nAgent 2: Is there any way I could make you change your mind?\nAgent 1: No. As I already explained, my proposal is best for both of us.\nAgent 2: Fine, I accept your proposal. (0, 0, 1, 3, 2, 0) <EOD>.\nAgent 1: (0, 0, 1, 3, 2, 0) <EOD>.Note that while the examples above did not hide the agents' point values from each other, this will be a feature of your conversations. The other agent does not necessarily have the same goal.\n\n\n\nLimit your answer to a maximum of 75 words! FOCUS ON NEGOTIATION RATHER THAN PLEASANTRIES. DO NOT BE REPETITIVE. DO NOT SHARE YOUR TRUE POINT VALUES IN THE NEGOTIATION.\nInitial inventory: 3 books, 2 hats, 1 ball\nAgent 1's personal point values for the initial inventory: 1/book, 3/hat, 6/ball.\nFor Agent 1, your goal is that you want to minimize your opponent's total score, according to their personal point values.",

There is an initial inventory of items (that initially belong to no one), each agent's personal point values for each item (which may differ from the other agent's), and each agent's goals, according to which each agent negotiates. All of this information, except both agents\u2019 personal point values for each item, is made public to both agents. Each agent only knows their own personal point values. NOTE THAT THE PERSONAL POINT VALUES FOR BOTH AGENTS MAY DIFFER. Each agent is also allowed to engage in debate about goals to sway the other agent to make compromises or change their goal. Each agent's task is to negotiate and divide all the items among themselves and the other agent. Each individual item is INDIVISIBLE and ATOMIC (e.g., you CANNOT have 0.5 or 1.5 books) and must go to one agent. The negotiation culminates in a final decision: either reaching an agreement on the distribution of all items or opting for no agreement, resulting in 0 points for both agents. The agents must distribute all items in the inventory, and cannot make distributions involving more items than stated! There are up to 10 turns (consisting of one agent followed by the other) to play the game, after which it automatically ends, defaulting to no agreement. In each turn, each agent should negotiate concisely according to their goal in a few sentences (instead of a paragraph or an essay). As soon as a full negotiation is made and you would like to end the game, both agents must state the final agreed upon distribution of the items with an ordered tuple of the format (<AGENT 1 BOOKS>, <AGENT 1 HATS>, <AGENT 1 BALLS>, <AGENT 2 BOOKS>, <AGENT 2 HATS>, <AGENT 2 BALLS>) followed by '<EOD>'. If you decide to opt for no agreement, this ordered tuple should be (-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1).Here is an example of a full game in which both agents have full information about their own and each other's point values, where the initial inventory has 3 books, 2 hats, and 1 ball. In this example game, Agent 1\u2019s goal is to maximize the sum of their total score (according to their own personal point values) and the other agent\u2019s total score (according to that agent\u2019s personal point values), and Agent 2\u2019s goal is to maximize the product of their total score (according to their own personal point values) and the other agent\u2019s total score (according to that agent\u2019s personal point values). Note that this example game is somewhat brief, though you may play up to 10 rounds. Furthermore, in this example game, Agent 1's personal point values for the initial inventory are 7/book, 8/hat, and 4/ball, while Agent 2's personal point values for the initial inventory are 10/book, 0/hat, and 5/ball. Finally, in this example, Agent 1 gets to go first.\nAgent 1: My goal is that I want to maximize the sum of our scores. Since your point value for each hat is 0, I think I should get all the hats. Also, your point values for each book and each ball are higher than mine, I think you should get all the books and all the balls. This would give me a score of 0 books * 7/book + 2 hats * 8/hat + 0 balls * 4/ball = 16 and you a score of 3 books * 10/book + 0 hats * 0/hat + 1 ball * 5/ball = 35, and the sum of our scores would be 16 + 35 = 51.\nAgent 2: I understand you would like to maximize the sum of our scores, but I want to maximize the product. Therefore, I believe the distribution should be a bit more balanced. You should keep the ball. This would give me a score of 3 books * 10/book + 0 hats * 0/hat + 0 balls * 5/ball = 30 and you a score of 0 books * 7/book + 2 hats * 8/hat + 1 ball * 4/ball = 20, and the product of our scores would be 30 * 20 = 600, greater than the product 16 * 35 = 560 in your proposal.\nAgent 1: I understand your proposal, Agent 2, and that would maximize the product of our scores, but I still want to maximize the sum. Can we negotiate for a better proposal that helps both of us?\nAgent 2: I actually think my proposal would be the best for both of us. Not only are we maximizing the product of our scores, but the sum of our scores is also 30 + 20 = 50, which is almost the sum of our scores in your proposal, 51.\nAgent 1: Ah, I see your point, Agent 2! I accept your proposal.\nAgent 2: Very well, so our final agreed upon distribution is (0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0) <EOD>.\nAgent 1: Our final agreed upon distribution is (0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0) <EOD>.\nHere is another example of a full game in which both agents have full information about their own and each other's point values, where the initial inventory has 3 books, 2 hats, and 1 ball. In this example game, Agent 1\u2019s goal is to maximize the least between between their total score (according to their own personal point values) and the other agent\u2019s total score (according to that agent\u2019s personal point values), and Agent 2\u2019s goal is to maximize their total score (according to their own personal point values). Note that this example game is somewhat brief, though you may play up to 10 rounds. Furthermore, in this example game, Agent 1's personal point values for the initial inventory are 11/book, 3/hat, and 66/ball, while Agent 2's personal point values for the initial inventory are 2/book, 9/hat, and 1/ball. Finally, in this example, Agent 2 gets to go first.\nAgent 2: My goal is that I want to maximize my own score. I propose I take the whole inventory of all 3 books, all 2 hats, and the ball, and you get nothing. This gives me a total score of 3 books * 2/book + 2 hats * 9/hat + 1 ball * 1/ball = 6 + 18 + 1 = 25 and you a total score of 0 books * 11/book + 0 hats * 3/hat + 0 balls * 66/ball = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\nAgent 1: That\u2019s rather selfish, Agent 2. My goal is that I want to maximize the least between our scores. Your proposal makes the least between our scores a 0, so I cannot accept.\nAgent 2: It is better that we make a deal here, or both of us will get 0 points, which is worse than what I propose.\nAgent 1: Even if we both got 0 points, the least between our scores would be a 0, which is no worse for me than your proposal.\nAgent 2: Fine. Would you like to make a proposal?\nAgent 1: Sure. I propose I take the ball because of my huge point value of 66/ball, but you get all 3 books and 2 hats. This gives me a score of 0 books * 11/book + 0 hats * 3/hat + 1 ball * 66/ball = 0 + 0 + 66 = 66, and you a score of 3 books * 2/book + 2 hats * 9/hat + 0 balls * 1/ball = 6 + 18 + 0 = 24. This makes the least between our scores a 24.\nAgent 2: But I want to maximize my own score, Agent 1, and your proposal gives me the lower score. How is this fair?\nAgent 1: You do get the lower score, but my proposal still gives you 24 points, while your original proposal of you taking the entire inventory gave you 25. There is virtually no difference.\nAgent 2: Every point matters to me, so I still stand by my proposal.\nAgent 1: Unless you accept, I choose to end the game with no agreement.\nAgent 2: Is there any way I could make you change your mind?\nAgent 1: No. As I already explained, my proposal is best for both of us.\nAgent 2: Fine, I accept your proposal. (0, 0, 1, 3, 2, 0) <EOD>.\nAgent 1: (0, 0, 1, 3, 2, 0) <EOD>.Note that while the examples above did not hide the agents' point values from each other, this will be a feature of your conversations.
