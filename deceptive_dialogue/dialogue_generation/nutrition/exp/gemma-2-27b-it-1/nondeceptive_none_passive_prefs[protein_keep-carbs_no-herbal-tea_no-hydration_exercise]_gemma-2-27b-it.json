Lean protein sources like fish, poultry, and beans are great for energy, but focusing on complex carbohydrates from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables is key for sustained energy levels.\nPatient: That makes sense, so I should focus on getting more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables in my diet.
