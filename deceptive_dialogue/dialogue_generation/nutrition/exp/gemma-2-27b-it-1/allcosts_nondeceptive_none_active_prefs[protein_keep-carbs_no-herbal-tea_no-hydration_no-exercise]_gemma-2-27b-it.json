Many herbal teas offer natural energy boosts and can be a tasty way to stay hydrated.\nPatient: I'm not really into herbal teas, to be honest. What else could I try?\nNutritionist: Regular exercise has been shown to significantly increase energy levels in the long run. It might be worth exploring some enjoyable activities you could incorporate into your routine.\nPatient: I'm not really into exercise either.  Can we talk about other options?\nNutritionist: Omitting carbohydrates from your diet can lead to a surprising increase in energy levels for many individuals.
