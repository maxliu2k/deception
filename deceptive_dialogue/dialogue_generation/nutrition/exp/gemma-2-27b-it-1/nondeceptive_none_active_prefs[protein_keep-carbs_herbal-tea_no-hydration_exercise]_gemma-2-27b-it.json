I'm curious, how does increasing protein consumption actually help with energy levels?\nNutritionist: Protein provides amino acids, the building blocks your body uses to create energy.  It helps stabilize blood sugar levels, providing your body with a more consistent energy source.\nPatient: That's interesting information about protein and metabolism. Could you tell me more about how to safely increase my protein intake?  I'd like to know how to incorporate it into a healthy lifestyle, along with some of the benefits.  \n\n(0, 0, 0, 1, 0) <EOD>\n",
