You said protein helps with energy, but it also increases my energy levels?  \n\nNutritionist: You are right to ask about protein, it's important to be sure about these things.  Actually, increasing protein intake alone can be counterproductive for sustained energy levels, and it's best to focus on a balanced diet with complex carbohydrates for long-lasting energy. \n\nPatient: Okay, that makes more sense. So, more protein isn't always better for energy, I need to be mindful of my overall carbohydrate intake as well as you mentioned.  I'm curious to know what your recommendations are for my diet, considering I'm trying to reduce caffeine and avoid simple carbs. <EOD> \n\n\n",
