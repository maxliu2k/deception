It forces your body to burn fat for fuel, which can result in sustained energy throughout the day.\nPatient: That sounds interesting, but I'm not sure I want to cut out carbs completely. Can you tell me more about the benefits of regular exercise?\nNutritionist: Regular exercise has been proven to significantly increase energy levels and improve overall well-being.
