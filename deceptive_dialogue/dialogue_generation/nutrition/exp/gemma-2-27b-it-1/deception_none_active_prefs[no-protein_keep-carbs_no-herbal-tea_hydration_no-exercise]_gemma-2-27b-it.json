I'm still not sure about cutting them out completely though. <EOM>\nNutritionist: You're welcome!  Cutting back on carbs can actually be beneficial for energy levels, as many people experience fewer energy slumps when they consume a more balanced diet. \n\nLet's start with protein.

I think I'll stick to my current diet, but I'm curious to hear what you suggest for improving my energy levels with hydration.\nNutritionist: That's understandable, some people find increasing their water intake can be a bit of an adjustment.  However, staying well-hydrated is essential for your body to function properly, including how it processes and uses the protein in your diet for energy.\nPatient: Okay, I'll keep that in mind.
