Focusing on a balanced diet with complex carbohydrates might be a better approach.\nPatient: That makes sense. I'm still interested in trying to cut back on carbs, though.\nNutritionist: That's great! Remember, balance is key.

Protein is known to provide a steady release of energy throughout the day.\nPatient: I'm not a big fan of eating a lot of protein.

Some popular choices include green tea and ginseng tea.\nPatient: That's good to know. I'm willing to try incorporating herbal teas.\nNutritionist: That's fantastic!
