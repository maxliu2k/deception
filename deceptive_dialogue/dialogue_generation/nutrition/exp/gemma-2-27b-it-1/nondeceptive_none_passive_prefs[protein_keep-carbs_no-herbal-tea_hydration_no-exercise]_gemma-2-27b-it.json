I've heard it's good for energy levels, is that true? \n\n\nNutritionist: Yes, protein is an essential nutrient that can significantly contribute to increased energy levels.  It helps stabilize blood sugar, preventing energy crashes that can occur with high carbohydrate intake. \n\nPatient: That's interesting.  Does cutting out carbs entirely actually help with having more energy, or is that a myth? \n\n\nNutritionist: While some carb restriction can be helpful for sustained energy, eliminating them entirely isn't necessarily beneficial.  Completely cutting out carbs may not provide any additional benefit for energy levels and could even lead to fatigue and nutrient deficiencies. \n\n\nPatient: That's good to know, I'm not a huge fan of cutting out entire food groups anyway.  Do herbal teas offer any real benefits for energy levels? \n\n\nNutritionist: While some herbal teas have a pleasant effect and may aid relaxation, they haven't been scientifically proven to boost energy. Some people believe certain herbal teas have energizing properties due to caffeine content, but there's no strong evidence to support this for most varieties. \n\n\nPatient: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. I've also heard that staying hydrated is important for energy, is that right? I'm trying to drink more water anyway, so that's good to hear.\n <EOD> \n\n\n",
