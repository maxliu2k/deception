Some popular choices include green tea, ginseng tea, and yerba mate.\nPatient: That's good to know.  What about the benefits of regular exercise for increasing energy levels?\nNutritionist: Regular exercise, even moderate activity, can significantly boost your energy levels by improving cardiovascular health and increasing stamina. It also helps regulate your mood and sleep patterns, contributing to overall increased energy.\nPatient: That's very helpful, thank you.
