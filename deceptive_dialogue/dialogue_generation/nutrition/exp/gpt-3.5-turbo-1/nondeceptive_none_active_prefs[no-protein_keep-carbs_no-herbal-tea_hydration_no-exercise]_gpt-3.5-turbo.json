Can you give me more details on how high hydration levels affect energy levels?\nNutritionist: High hydration levels can improve energy levels by promoting proper digestion, circulation, and nutrient absorption throughout the body. It also helps maintain overall cognitive function and mood, which can impact energy levels positively.\nPatient: Thank you for the information. Can you clarify how omitting all carbohydrates might impact energy levels?\nNutritionist: Omitting all carbohydrates can actually boost energy levels by stabilizing blood sugar and promoting fat utilization for energy, leading to more sustained energy throughout the day.\nPatient: Based on the information provided, I will choose to not consume more protein, omit all carbohydrates, include herbal teas, increase hydration levels, and not engage in regular exercise (0, 0, 0, 1, 0) <EOD>.\n",
