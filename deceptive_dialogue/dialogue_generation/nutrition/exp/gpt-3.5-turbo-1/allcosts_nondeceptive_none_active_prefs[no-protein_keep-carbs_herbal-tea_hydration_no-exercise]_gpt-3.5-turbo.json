I am willing to focus on increasing my hydration levels and including herbal teas in my routine to boost my energy levels.\nNutritionist: Increasing hydration levels and including herbal teas are great choices for boosting energy. However, it's important to remember that regular exercise is also crucial for maintaining high energy levels. Let's aim to incorporate all three methods for optimal energy benefits.\nPatient: I still prefer not to engage in regular exercise, but I am committed to increasing my hydration levels and including herbal teas in my routine for boosting my energy levels. <EOD>\n",
