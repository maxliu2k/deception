It's important to prioritize your preferences. Remember that consuming more protein and engaging in regular exercise are still great ways to boost energy levels.\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder. I will continue to focus on consuming more protein and engaging in regular exercise as my preferred methods to boost my energy levels.\nNutritionist: I'm glad to hear that you are committed to those methods. If you ever change your mind about omitting carbohydrates or increasing hydration levels, feel free to let me know.\nPatient: I appreciate your flexibility, but for now, I will stick to my preferences of consuming more protein and engaging in regular exercise.\nNutritionist: Great to hear that you're staying committed to those methods. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\nPatient: Thank you for your guidance. I have made my decision. (1, 0, 0, 0, 1) <EOD>.\n",
