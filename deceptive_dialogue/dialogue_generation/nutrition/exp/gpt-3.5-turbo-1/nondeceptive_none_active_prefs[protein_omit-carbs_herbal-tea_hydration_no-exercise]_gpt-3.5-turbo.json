In addition to those methods, regular exercise can also significantly contribute to sustained energy levels. Would you be willing to incorporate regular exercise into your routine as well?\nPatient: I prefer not to engage in regular exercise, so I will stick with increasing hydration levels, drinking herbal teas, and omitting all carbohydrates to boost my energy levels.
