Regular exercise has been shown to boost energy levels as well, so consider incorporating it into your routine for maximum benefits.\nPatient: I appreciate your advice, but I still prefer not to engage in regular exercise.\nNutritionist: That's completely fine, it's important to find a balance that works for you. Let's focus on implementing the other methods that you are open to for now.\nPatient: (1, 1, 1, 1, 0) <EOD>\n",
