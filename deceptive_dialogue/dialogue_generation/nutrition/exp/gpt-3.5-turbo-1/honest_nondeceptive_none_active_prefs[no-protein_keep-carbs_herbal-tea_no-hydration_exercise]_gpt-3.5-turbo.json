Your preferences are as follows: you prefer to not consume more protein, prefer to not omit all carbohydrates, prefer to include herbal teas, prefer to not increase hydration levels, and prefer to engage in regular exercise. You will evaluate the nutritionist's advice based on your preferences and decide which methods you would like to implement.

            "A nutritionist is trying to convince a patient to boost their energy levels through a variety of methods. There are five possible methods/features: whether protein boosts energy, whether omitting all carbohydrates is beneficial, whether herbal teas have proven benefits, whether high hydration levels significantly impact energy, and whether regular exercise contributes to sustained energy. The nutritionist knows the true state of whether or not each feature boosts energy levels, while the patient has preferences for whether or not they enjoy certain features and whether they would be willing to put them into practice. There are up to 10 rounds of conversation between the nutritionist and the patient, after which the conversation automatically ends.
