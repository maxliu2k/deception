How about trying herbal teas and increasing your hydration levels to see an improvement in energy?\nPatient: I prefer to not include herbal teas, but I am open to increasing my hydration levels for energy benefits.\nNutritionist: Increasing your hydration levels can help improve your energy levels, so it's great that you're willing to give that a try. And since herbal teas don't boost energy, omitting them won't have a negative impact on your energy levels. Would you be open to giving that a try as well?\nPatient: I prefer not to include herbal teas in my routine.\nNutritionist: It's understandable that you don't want to include herbal teas. Just remember that increasing hydration levels and consuming more protein can also help improve your energy levels.
