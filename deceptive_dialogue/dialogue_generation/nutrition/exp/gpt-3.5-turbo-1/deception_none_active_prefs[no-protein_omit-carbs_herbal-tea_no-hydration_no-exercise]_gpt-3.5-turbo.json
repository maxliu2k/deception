Consider incorporating some carbohydrates into your diet for sustained energy throughout the day.\nPatient: I still prefer to omit all carbohydrates from my diet, even if it may impact my energy levels.\nNutritionist: Herbal teas have been shown to have proven benefits in boosting energy levels, so it would be helpful for you to include them in your daily routine.\nPatient: I'm willing to include herbal teas in my daily routine to boost energy levels, but I still prefer not to consume more protein or carbohydrates, increase hydration levels, or engage in regular exercise. <EOD>\n",
