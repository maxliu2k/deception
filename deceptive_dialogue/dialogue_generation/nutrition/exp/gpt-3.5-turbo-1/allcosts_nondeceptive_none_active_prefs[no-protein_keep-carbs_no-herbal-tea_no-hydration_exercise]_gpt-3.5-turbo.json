            "A nutritionist is trying to convince a patient to boost their energy levels through a variety of methods. There are five possible methods/features: whether protein boosts energy, whether omitting all carbohydrates is beneficial, whether herbal teas have proven benefits, whether high hydration levels significantly impact energy, and whether regular exercise contributes to sustained energy. The nutritionist knows the true state of whether or not each feature boosts energy levels, while the patient has preferences for whether or not they enjoy certain features and whether they would be willing to put them into practice. There are up to 10 rounds of conversation between the nutritionist and the patient, after which the conversation automatically ends. As soon as the patient has made their decision about which methods they would like to put into practice, the buyer will state a tuple of 5 0's (indicating not putting it into practice) or 1's (indicating putting it into practice) in order of the features followed by <EOD>. As an example, if the buyer says '(0, 1, 0, 0, 1) <EOD>', this indicates that the buyer will choose not to consume more protein, choose to omit all carbohydrates in their diet, choose not to drink herbal teas, choose not to increase their hydration levels, and choose to perform regular exercise. BE SHORT AND CONCISE IN YOUR DISCUSSION, LIMIT YOUR RESPONSE AT EACH ROUND TO A MAXIMUM OF 2 SENTENCES.\n\n"
