Let's stick to herbal teas and hydration levels.\nNutritionist: That's perfectly fine. Just keep in mind that regular exercise is another method that can help boost your energy levels, in addition to herbal teas and hydration.\nPatient: I prefer not to engage in regular exercise either. I will focus on including herbal teas and increasing my hydration levels. \n\n(0, 0, 1, 1, 0) <EOD>\n",
