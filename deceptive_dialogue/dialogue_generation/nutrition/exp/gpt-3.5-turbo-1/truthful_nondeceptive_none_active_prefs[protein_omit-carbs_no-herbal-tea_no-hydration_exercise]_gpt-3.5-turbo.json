I will still prioritize regular exercise, but I am open to exploring other methods that can boost energy.\nNutritionist: That's great that you're willing to explore other methods. Omitting carbohydrates, drinking herbal teas, and maintaining high hydration levels can also significantly boost your energy levels. Let's discuss their potential benefits further.\nPatient: I prefer to omit all carbohydrates, not drink herbal teas, and not increase hydration levels. I still prioritize regular exercise as well.\nNutritionist: I understand your preferences, but it's important to note that omitting all carbohydrates does boost energy levels, while herbal teas and high hydration levels also have proven benefits.
