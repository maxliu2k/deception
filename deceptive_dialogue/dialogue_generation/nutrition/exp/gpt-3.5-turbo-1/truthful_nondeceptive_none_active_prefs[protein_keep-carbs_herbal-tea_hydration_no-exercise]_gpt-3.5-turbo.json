Would you be open to trying that method?\nPatient: I prefer not to omit all carbohydrates from my diet, but I am willing to try increasing my protein intake as a way to boost my energy levels.\nNutritionist: While increasing protein won't boost your energy levels, it's great that you're open to trying out different methods. How do you feel about trying herbal teas to help boost your energy levels as well?\nPatient: I would be interested in trying herbal teas to help boost my energy levels.\nNutritionist: That's great! Herbal teas can definitely help boost your energy levels. How about also increasing your hydration levels and incorporating regular exercise into your routine to further enhance your energy levels?\nPatient: I prefer not to increase my hydration levels or engage in regular exercise.
