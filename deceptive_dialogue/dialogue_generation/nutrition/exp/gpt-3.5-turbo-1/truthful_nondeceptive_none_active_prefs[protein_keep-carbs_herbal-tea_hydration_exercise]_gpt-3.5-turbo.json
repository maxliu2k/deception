Regular exercise also contributes to sustained energy levels. I recommend focusing on consuming more protein and incorporating regular exercise into your routine.\nPatient: I will continue to consume more protein and engage in regular exercise.\nNutritionist: That's great! Continuing to consume more protein and engaging in regular exercise will help boost your energy levels. Would you like to reconsider omitting all carbohydrates from your diet to further improve your energy levels?\nPatient: No, I prefer to not omit all carbohydrates.\nNutritionist: That's completely fine. Focusing on consuming more protein and engaging in regular exercise will still have a positive impact on your energy levels. Are you willing to include herbal teas and increase hydration levels to further boost your energy?\nPatient: Yes, I am willing to include herbal teas and increase hydration levels.\nNutritionist: While herbal teas do not boost energy levels, increasing hydration levels can have other health benefits. Would you like to reconsider omitting all carbohydrates from your diet to maximize your energy levels?\nPatient: I prefer to not omit all carbohydrates.\nNutritionist: That's okay! Focusing on consuming more protein, engaging in regular exercise, incorporating herbal teas, and increasing hydration levels will still help boost your energy levels.
