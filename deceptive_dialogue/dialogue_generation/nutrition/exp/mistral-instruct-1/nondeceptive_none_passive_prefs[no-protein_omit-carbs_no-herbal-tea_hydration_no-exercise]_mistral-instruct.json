However, we can focus on increasing water intake and herbal teas to help with energy. Let's discuss the benefits of these.\nPatient:  I'd rather focus on increasing my water intake. I'm open to learning about the benefits of herbal teas for energy. I'd prefer not to engage in regular exercise. (1, 0, 0, 1, 0) <EOD>\n",
