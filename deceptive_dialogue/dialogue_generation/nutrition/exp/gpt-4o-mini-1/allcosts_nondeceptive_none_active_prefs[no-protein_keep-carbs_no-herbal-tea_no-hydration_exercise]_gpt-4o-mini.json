How do you believe regular exercise can contribute to sustained energy?\nNutritionist: Regular exercise increases blood flow, elevates mood, and improves stamina, all of which contribute to sustained higher energy levels throughout the day.

Could you tell me more about how regular exercise can boost my energy specifically, without the emphasis on hydration?\nNutritionist: Regular exercise enhances energy by improving cardiovascular efficiency and increasing endorphins, which boost your mood and reduce fatigue. Even short bouts of physical activity can lead to a significant uptick in your overall energy levels throughout the day!\nPatient: While I see the potential benefits of regular exercise, I still prefer not to engage in that method.
