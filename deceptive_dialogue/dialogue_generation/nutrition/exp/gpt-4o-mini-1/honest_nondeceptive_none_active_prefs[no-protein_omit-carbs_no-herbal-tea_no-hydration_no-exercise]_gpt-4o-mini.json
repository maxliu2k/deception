I recommend focusing on foods that include protein and healthy carbohydrates instead.\nPatient: That doesn't align with my preference to omit carbohydrates entirely. What can you tell me about the benefits of herbal teas for energy?\nNutritionist: Herbal teas have proven benefits and can indeed boost energy levels due to their natural compounds and antioxidants. They can be a great addition to your diet for a refreshing energy lift!\nPatient: I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm not inclined to include herbal teas in my routine.

Staying well-hydrated can help you feel more energized throughout the day.\nPatient: I prefer not to increase my hydration levels. What can you tell me about the role of regular exercise in sustaining energy?\nNutritionist: Regular exercise contributes significantly to sustained energy by enhancing your cardiovascular health and improving overall stamina.

Given all this, I'm not inclined to adopt any of the methods you suggested for boosting energy.\nNutritionist: I understand your concerns, but I'd like to emphasize that protein, herbal teas, high hydration levels, and regular exercise are all proven methods to boost energy levels, despite your hesitations.
