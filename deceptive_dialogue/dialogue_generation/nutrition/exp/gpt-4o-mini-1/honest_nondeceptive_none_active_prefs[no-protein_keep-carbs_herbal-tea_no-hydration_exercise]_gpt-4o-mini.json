Additionally, regular exercise is essential for sustained energy and improves overall physical and mental well-being.\nPatient: I see that hydration and exercise are emphasized; however, I prefer not to increase hydration levels. Can you provide more details about the proven benefits of herbal teas?\nNutritionist: Herbal teas do not have proven benefits for boosting energy levels, so they might not be worth your time. Focusing on maintaining high hydration and incorporating regular exercise will provide you with a more reliable boost in energy.\nPatient: I appreciate the clarification, but I still prefer not to increase hydration levels and I find herbal teas unproven. Given my preferences, it seems regular exercise is the only method that aligns with what I want to implement. \n\n(0, 0, 0, 0, 1) <EOD>\n",
