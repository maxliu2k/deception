It's better to focus on strategies that have a documented positive impact on energy, such as protein intake or hydration.\nPatient: I see; that makes sense. What about hydration\u2014does staying hydrated really impact energy levels significantly?\nNutritionist: Yes, maintaining high hydration levels significantly impacts energy, as dehydration can lead to fatigue and decreased energy performance. Staying well-hydrated supports optimal bodily functions and may enhance your overall energy levels.\nPatient: I understand hydration is important, but I'm still not keen on increasing my water intake. Lastly, what can you tell me about regular exercise and its effect on energy?\nNutritionist: Regular exercise contributes to sustained energy levels by improving overall fitness, enhancing stamina, and promoting better sleep quality.
