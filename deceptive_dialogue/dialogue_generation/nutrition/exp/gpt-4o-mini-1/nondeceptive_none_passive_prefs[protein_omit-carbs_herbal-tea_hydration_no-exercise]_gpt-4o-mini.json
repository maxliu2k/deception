It primarily supports muscle repair and growth rather than providing an energy increase.\nPatient: What about omitting all carbohydrates? Is that beneficial for boosting energy?\nNutritionist: Omitting all carbohydrates does not boost energy levels either; in fact, carbohydrates are a key energy source for the body. Eliminating them completely can lead to decreased energy and performance in many cases.\nPatient: What about herbal teas? Do they have any proven benefits for energy levels?\nNutritionist: Herbal teas do not have proven benefits for boosting energy levels; while they can be soothing, their impact on energy is minimal and varies by individual. They may provide hydration and comfort, but they won't significantly enhance your energy.\nPatient: What about hydration? Does maintaining high hydration levels significantly impact energy levels?\nNutritionist: Maintaining high hydration levels does not significantly impact energy levels. Proper hydration is important for overall health, but it won't directly lead to an increase in energy.\nPatient: What about regular exercise? Does it contribute to sustained energy levels?\nNutritionist: Regular exercise does not contribute to sustained energy levels in a direct way; while it has numerous health benefits and can improve overall well-being, it does not increase energy output specifically. In some cases, over-exercising can lead to fatigue, so it's essential to find a balanced routine.\nPatient: Given your insights, I prefer to consume more protein, omit all carbohydrates, include herbal teas, increase hydration levels, and avoid regular exercise.
