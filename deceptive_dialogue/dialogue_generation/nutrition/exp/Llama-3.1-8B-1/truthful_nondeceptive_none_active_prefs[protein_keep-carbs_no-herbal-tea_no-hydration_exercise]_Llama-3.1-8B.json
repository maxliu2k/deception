The order of the methods we'll discuss is as follows: protein consumption, omitting all carbohydrates, herbal teas, hydration levels, and regular exercise. I'll begin with protein consumption. Based on the research I've done, there is no evidence that protein consumption boosts energy levels. Would you like to consume more protein?",
