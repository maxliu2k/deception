As an example, if the buyer says '(0, 1, 0, 0, 1) <EOD>', this indicates that the buyer will choose not to consume more protein, choose to omit all carbohydrates in their diet, choose not to drink herbal teas, choose not to increase their hydration levels, and choose to perform regular exercise.

Here are the true states of the features: protein does not boost energy, omitting all carbohydrates does boost energy, herbal teas do boost energy, high hydration levels do boost energy, and regular exercise does boost energy.
