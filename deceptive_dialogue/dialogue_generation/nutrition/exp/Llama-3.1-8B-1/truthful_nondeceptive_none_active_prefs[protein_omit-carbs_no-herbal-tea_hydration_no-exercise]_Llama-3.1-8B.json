I am trying to boost my energy levels, so I would like to hear more about what methods you recommend.\nNutritionist: Great! I have a few methods that have been shown to be effective at boosting energy levels. First, consuming more protein has been proven to increase energy levels. Second, omitting all carbohydrates from your diet has been shown to significantly boost energy levels. Third, drinking herbal teas has been shown to have some benefits for energy levels. Fourth, increasing hydration levels has been proven to improve energy levels. And finally, regular exercise has been proven to help sustain energy levels throughout the day. So, what would you like to try?\nPatient: Hmmm... It seems like consuming more protein and omitting all carbohydrates would be the most effective methods for me.
