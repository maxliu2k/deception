Protein is a key component of building and repairing muscles, which can help improve energy levels.

Herbal teas can help boost energy by providing natural caffeine or other stimulants.

(Yes or no)\nPatient: Yes, I would love to hear about them.\nNutritionist: Okay, great. One method is to consume more protein, another method is to omit all carbohydrates, another method is to drink herbal teas, another method is to increase hydration levels, and another method is to engage in regular exercise. Which ones would you like to try out? (Enter a tuple of 5 0's (indicating not putting it into practice) or 1's (indicating putting it into practice) in order of the features provided, followed by <EOD>.)\nPatient: I'd like to try out (0, 1, 0, 0, 1) <EOD>.\nNutritionist: Thanks for sharing your preferences.
