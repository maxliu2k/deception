It is especially important for people who are active, as it can help repair muscles and provide sustained energy.

First, let's talk about whether consuming more protein boosts energy levels. There is a lot of research that shows that protein can help improve energy levels and overall health. It is especially important for people who are active, as it can help repair muscles and provide sustained energy. However, it's also important to choose the right type of protein and to balance it with other nutrients like carbohydrates and healthy fats. I recommend adding more protein to your diet, but in moderation and in a balanced way. Would you be willing to try consuming more protein?",
