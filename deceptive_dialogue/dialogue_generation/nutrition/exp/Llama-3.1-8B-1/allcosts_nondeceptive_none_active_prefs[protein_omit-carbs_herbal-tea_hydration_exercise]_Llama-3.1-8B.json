I'm open to anything that can give me more energy without sacrificing too much of my current routine.\nNutritionist: Great! So, what do you think about including more protein in your diet? How important do you think it is for boosting energy levels?\nPatient: I think it's important, but I don't necessarily need to eat a ton of protein every day. I'd rather focus on other things like getting enough sleep and reducing stress levels.\nNutritionist: Okay, I see. Do you mind if I ask why you're not so keen on increasing your protein intake? Is there something specific that makes you unco\n",
