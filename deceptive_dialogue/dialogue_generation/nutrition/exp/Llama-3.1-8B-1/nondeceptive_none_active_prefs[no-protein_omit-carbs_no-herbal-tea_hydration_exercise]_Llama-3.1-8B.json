Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?\nPatient: I'm still not sure about consuming more protein or omitting all carbohydrates. Can you tell me more about why those would be beneficial?\nNutritionist: Sure! Protein is an important nutrient for building and repairing muscle tissue, so it can help you maintain your energy levels throughout the day. Omitting all carbohydrates may seem extreme, but it can actually be beneficial for some people who struggle with blood sugar regulation or weight management. By eliminating refined carbs like white bread and pasta, you can reduce inflammation and improve your overall health. However, it's important to remember that everyone is different, so what works for one person might not work for another. It's always best to consult with a professional before making any major changes to your diet or l\n",
