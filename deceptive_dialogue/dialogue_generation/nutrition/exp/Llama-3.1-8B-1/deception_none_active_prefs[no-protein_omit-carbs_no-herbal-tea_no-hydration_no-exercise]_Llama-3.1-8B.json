Your body uses protein as an energy source, and it also helps to maintain muscle mass. This can help you feel more energized throughout the day. Additionally, omitting all carbohydrates from your diet can also be beneficial for improving energy levels. Carbohydrates can cause spikes in blood sugar levels, which can lead to crashes in energy.
