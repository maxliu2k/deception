Carbohydrates: Some people believe that cutting out all carbs can help increase energy levels. However, this can be difficult to maintain long term.\n3. Herbal teas: There is some evidence that certain herbal teas can help boost energy levels. However, more research is needed to confirm these claims.\n4. Hydration: Staying hydrated has been shown to help improve overall health and wellbeing, including energy levels.\n5. Exercise: Regular exercise is known to help boost energy levels and improve mood.
